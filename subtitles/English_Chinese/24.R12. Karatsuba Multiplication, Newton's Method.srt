spend more time having fun with Newton.
花更多的时间在牛顿玩。 

37
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,260
So suppose we don't know Karatsuba.

38
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,920
We want to multiply two numbers.
我们想将两个数字相乘。 

39
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,945
What's the method that we learned in elementary school?
我们在小学学到了什么方法？ 

40
00:01:32,945 --> 00:01:35,750
AUDIENCE: You take the first digit of the first number,
听众：您采用第一个数字的第一位数字， 

41
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:39,445
and then you multiply it by the second number.
然后将其乘以第二个数字。 

42
00:01:39,445 --> 00:01:40,890
And then you take the second digit
然后你取第二个数字

43
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:44,284
and multiply it by the second number, but then you add a 0.

44
00:01:44,284 --> 00:01:47,259
And so on and so forth.
等等等等。 

45
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:49,790
PROFESSOR: So I'll take this digit

49
00:01:58,359 --> 00:01:59,150
write the result.

What's the running time for this?
这是什么时间？ 

57
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:30,085



58
00:02:30,284 --> 00:02:31,606
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].
听众：[听不清]。 

59
00:02:31,606 --> 00:02:32,189
PROFESSOR: OK.
教授：好的。 

60
00:02:32,189 --> 00:02:37,689



61
00:02:37,689 --> 00:02:39,899
So why is it n squared?
那么为什么n平方呢？ 

62
00:02:39,899 --> 00:02:42,024
AUDIENCE: Because you go through every single thing
听众：因为您经历了每件事

63
00:02:42,024 --> 00:02:43,716
for every digit below.
对于下面的每个数字。 

64
00:02:43,716 --> 00:02:44,340
PROFESSOR: Yup.
教授：是的。 

65
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,560
So I'll have these partial products here,
所以我这里有这些部分产品， 

66
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,189
and I have as many partial products
我有很多局部产品

67
00:02:50,389 --> 00:02:51,779
as digits in the second number.
作为第二个数字中的数字。 

68
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:56,250
So if I have n digits here, I have n partial products.
因此，如果我在这里有n个数字，则我有n个部分乘积。 

69
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,219
Each partial product is this first number here multiplied
每个部分乘积是此第一个数字的乘积

70
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:00,520
by a digit.
一个数字。 

71
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,870
So if this guy has n digits, then there

72
00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:06,169
are n digits everywhere here.
这里到处都是n位数字。 

73
00:03:06,169 --> 00:03:09,250
And this thing will be 2 n insides actually,
这个东西实际上是2 n内

74
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,629
but we're doing asymptotic, so we don't really
但是我们正在渐近，所以我们不是真的

75
00:03:11,629 --> 00:03:13,449
care about constant factors.
关心恒定因素。 

76
00:03:13,449 --> 00:03:15,729
So in the end, you have to add up n numbers.
所以最后，您必须累加n个数字。 

77
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:17,889
All of them are order n in size.
它们的大小均为n阶。 

78
00:03:17,889 --> 00:03:20,529
So n times order n squared.
因此，n乘以n的平方。 

79
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:23,539
This is plain old multiplication.
这是普通的旧乘法。 

80
00:03:23,539 --> 00:03:25,789
Does anyone know why Karatsuba's better?
有谁知道唐羽为什么更好？ 

81
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:29,574



82
00:03:29,574 --> 00:03:30,074
Yes?
是？ 

83
00:03:30,074 --> 00:03:32,287

92
00:03:52,854 --> 00:03:55,870
AUDIENCE: I said better, it's faster.

93
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,120
PROFESSOR: I mean, some algorithms have the same speed
教授：我的意思是，某些算法的速度相同

94
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,000
but are simpler.
但更简单。 

95
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:00,769
We like this one because it's faster.
我们喜欢这个，因为它速度更快。 

96
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:02,550
It's definitely not simpler.
绝对不是那么简单。 

97
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,210
So, it has this running time here.
因此，它具有此运行时间。 

98
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,090
Log 2 of 3 is a weird number.
 3的Log 2是一个奇怪的数字。 

99
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:08,050
It's somewhere between 1.5 and 2.
它介于1.5和2之间。 

100
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:13,250
So not revolutionary, but it's better than this guy.
所以不是革命性的，但是比这个家伙更好。 

101
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,419
OK, why do we get to this?
好吧，为什么我们要这么做呢？ 

102
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:16,959
How do we get to this?

103
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,879
Does anyone remember the recurrence for it?
有人记得它的复发吗？ 

104
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:21,629



105
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:22,894
Yes?

106
00:04:22,894 --> 00:04:24,288
AUDIENCE: It's 3 times 2--

00:04:26,793 --> 00:04:27,709
AUDIENCE: No, I'm not.
听众：不，我不是。 

110
00:04:27,709 --> 00:04:29,685
[LAUGHTER]
 [笑声] 

111
00:04:29,685 --> 00:04:35,459



112
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:37,459
PROFESSOR: So, let's see why it looks like this.
教授：那么，让我们看看为什么它看起来像这样。 

113
00:04:37,459 --> 00:04:48,589
Karatsuba takes 2 numbers that have n digits, splits both
唐津取2个具有n位数字的数字，将两者均分

114
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:57,310
of them up into two-- n over 2n, n over 2, n over 2, n over 2--
它们分为两个-n超过2n，n超过2，n超过2，n超过2-- 

115
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:00,300
and then is able to compute the product of these two numbers
然后能够计算这两个数字的乘积

116
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,829
by only using three multiplications, and then
通过仅使用三个乘法，然后

117
00:05:03,829 --> 00:05:05,159
some additions.
一些补充。 

118
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,360
Multiplications are expensive, additions are cheap.
乘法很昂贵，加法很便宜。 

119
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:15,629
So it does three multiplications that are of the form
所以它做三个乘法形式

120
00:05:15,829 --> 00:05:18,709
some number of n over 2 digits multiplied
超过2位数的n的数量相乘

121
00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:24,310
by some number of n over or 2 digits.
超过n或2位数。 

122
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:27,370
And exactly what the multiplications and what
到底是什么乘法和什么

123
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:31,199
the additions are is, it's interesting to look over it.
除了是，看看它很有趣。 

124
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,159
You can look over it, convince yourself that this is correct.
您可以查看一下，让自己确信这是正确的。 

125
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,579
Chances are you'll remember for the exam and forget afterwards.

00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:43,089
This is the essence of Karatsuba.
这就是唐津的本质。 

128
00:05:43,089 --> 00:05:49,531
And remember Karatsuba, because if you google this,
请记住唐津，因为如果您用Google搜索， 

129
00:05:49,531 --> 00:05:50,240
you get the rest.
你得到其余的。 

130
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,603



131
00:05:52,603 --> 00:05:54,269
So the multiplications are in the notes.
因此乘法在注释中。 

132
00:05:54,269 --> 00:05:57,039
I don't think it makes sense to spend some time on them
我认为花一些时间在他们身上没有意义

133
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,670
and convince you that, yeah, there
并说服你，是的，那里

134
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:01,180
are three multiplications that will get you that.
三个乘法将为您带来帮助。 

135
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:08,740
Instead, suppose I labeled these as a, b, c, d.
相反，假设我将它们标记为a，b，c，d。 

136
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:12,129
If I evaluate the multiplication as using brute force,
如果我将乘积评估为使用蛮力， 

137
00:06:12,129 --> 00:06:21,939
it's a times n over 2b plus c-- sorry, a plus-- no,
是n超过2b加c的倍数-抱歉，一个加号-不， 

138
00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:23,000
this isn't good.
这不好

139
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,300
10 to the power n over 2a plus b times 10-- assuming the base
 10乘以2a的幂n加b乘以10-假设基数

140
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:35,199
is ten, if it's not, you replace it-- n over 2 c plus d.
是十，如果不是，则将其替换-2 c加d上的n。 

141
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:46,029
And you get 10 to the n times, I think, ac plus 10
我想你得到10次到n次，交流加10 

142
00:06:46,029 --> 00:06:54,029
to the n over 2 times ad plus bc plus bd.
在2次广告中加上n加上bc加上bd。 

143
00:06:54,029 --> 00:06:57,819



144
00:06:57,819 --> 00:07:00,485
The problem with this is this is a multiplication,
问题在于这是一个乘法， 

145
00:07:00,485 --> 00:07:04,189
multiplication, multiplication, multiplication.
乘法，乘法，乘法。 

146
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:07,000
So this uses four multiplications
所以这使用了四个乘法

147
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,120
of size n over 2 to evaluate the answer one
 n大于2来评估答案之一

148
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,040
multiplication of size n.
大小n的乘积

149
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,800
And if I have four multiplications,
如果我有四个乘法， 

150
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:21,500
then the recursion becomes 4t of n over 2 plus o of n.
那么递归就变成2的n加o的n的4t。 

151
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:25,600



152
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,370
So this is t bad of n.
因此，这对n不利。 

153
00:07:27,569 --> 00:07:29,689
So if you do this using the recursion tree,
因此，如果您使用递归树来执行此操作， 

154
00:07:29,689 --> 00:07:35,790
you're going to see that-- yup, I hear whispers.
您会看到的-是的，我听到了耳语。 

155
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:36,970
n squared.
 n平方。 

156
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:39,389
So this isn't useful.
因此，这没有用。 

157
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:41,469
This will give you insight on how to do it,
这将使您了解如何执行此操作， 

158
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:44,060
but if you try to implement it this way,
但是如果您尝试以这种方式实施， 

159
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,360
you don't get any speed up.
你没有任何速度。 

160
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,971
The insight in Karatsuba is that the guy figured out
唐津的洞察力是那个家伙想通了

161
00:07:48,971 --> 00:07:50,720
how to do this with three multiplications.
如何用三个乘法做到这一点。 

162
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,420



163
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,259
OK, makes sense?
好吧，有道理吗？ 

164
00:07:56,259 --> 00:07:59,050
Is everyone happy with Karatsuba now?
现在每个人都对唐津感到满意吗？ 

165
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:02,605
So that multiplying by 10 to the n over 2 is just shifting a?
那么乘以10乘以n等于2就是将a移位？ 

166
00:08:02,605 --> 00:08:03,230
PROFESSOR: Yup.
教授：是的。 

167
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:03,603
OK.
好。 

168
00:08:03,803 --> 00:08:04,469
Very good point.
很好的一点。 

169
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:06,750
So this isn't an actual multiplication.
因此，这不是实际的乘法。 

170
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:14,589
If you have your number, say stored in a python list--
如果您有电话号码，请说存储在python列表中- 

171
00:08:14,589 --> 00:08:16,429
so if these are your digits, then
所以如果这些是你的数字，那么

172
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,939
in order to multiply by 10 to the n,
为了将n乘以10 

173
00:08:18,939 --> 00:08:21,959
you append 10 to the n 0s at the end.
您在末尾的n 0后面附加10。 

174
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:25,629
0, 0, 0, 0, 0.
 0、0、0、0、0。 

175
00:08:25,629 --> 00:08:34,408
So, this is append of 0 n times.
因此，这是0 n次附加。 

176
00:08:34,408 --> 00:08:37,200
So this is order n, so it counts as an addition, not as
所以这是n阶，所以算作加法，而不是

177
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,819
a multiplication.
乘法。 

178
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,439
So, these are free.
因此，这些都是免费的。 

179
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,870
These are expensive.
这些很贵。 

180
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:46,157
1, 2, 3, 4.
 1 2 3 4 

181
00:08:46,357 --> 00:08:51,319



182
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:51,820
OK.
好。 

183
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,829
Who's happy with Karatsuba now?
谁对唐津感到满意？ 

184
00:08:54,029 --> 00:08:56,744
Let me feel like I did something useful today.
让我觉得我今天做了一些有用的事情。 

185
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:57,709
AUDIENCE: I have a question.
听众：我有一个问题。 

186
00:08:57,909 --> 00:08:58,534
PROFESSOR: Yes.
教授：是的。 

187
00:08:58,534 --> 00:09:00,819
AUDIENCE: I didn't fully understand what [INAUDIBLE].
听众：我不完全明白[听不清]。 

188
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:05,820



189
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,100
PROFESSOR: So, I have this number
教授：所以我有这个电话

190
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,109
and I'm splitting it up into 2 halves.
我将其分为两半。 

191
00:09:11,309 --> 00:09:15,949
The way split up is I say this is a number of size n over 2,
拆分的方式是我说这是2的n个数

192
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:17,219
and I have to shift it to the left.
我必须将其向左移动

193
00:09:17,419 --> 00:09:21,870
So n 10 to the power of n over 2 shifts
所以n 10等于n的2次方的幂

194
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,960
it left by n over two digits.
它在两个数字上留下n。 

195
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,946
And then I add it to b.
然后将其添加到b。 

196
00:09:24,946 --> 00:09:26,320
So this in a sense is just saying
所以这从某种意义上说

197
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,353
that this is the left half, this is the right half.
这是左半部分，这是右半部分。 

198
00:09:28,553 --> 00:09:30,519
AUDIENCE: This is actually that same number.
听众：这实际上是相同的数字。 

199
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:30,774
PROFESSOR: Yup.
教授：是的。 

200
00:09:30,774 --> 00:09:32,100
It's exactly the same number.
这是完全相同的数字。 

201
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:37,820



202
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:41,238
OK, so who is happy with Karatsuba now?
好，那么现在谁对唐津感到满意？ 

203
00:09:41,438 --> 00:09:43,730
AUDIENCE: Wait, but that's four multiplications though.
听众：等等，但这是四个乘法。 

204
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:44,500
PROFESSOR: Exactly.
教授：是的。 

205
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,259
AUDIENCE: That's not three.
听众：不是三个。 

206
00:09:45,259 --> 00:09:45,639
PROFESSOR: Exactly.
教授：是的。 

207
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:47,559
AUDIENCE: But we said there were three.
听众：但是我们说有三个。 

208
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:49,569
PROFESSOR: So, I was saying that this,
教授：所以，我说的是， 

209
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:52,209
if you;re doing it the brute force way, you get four,
如果你用蛮力的方式做的话，你得到四个， 

210
00:09:52,409 --> 00:09:54,240
and that is slow.
那很慢。 

211
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,120
So what Karatsuba did is he figured out
所以他想出了Karatsuba所做的

212
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,580
the way to do this with just three multiplications.
只需三个乘法即可完成此操作的方法。 

213
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,580
So it's not these three.
所以不是这三个。 

214
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,319
You have to think a little bit more.
您必须多考虑一点。 

215
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,876
But you google it, or you look at the lecture notes,
但是你用谷歌搜索，或者看讲义， 

216
00:10:03,876 --> 00:10:05,709
or you think a little bit, then you find out
或稍微想一想，便会发现

217
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:09,700
the three multiplications that do the trick.
这三个技巧就完成了。 

218
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,720
So the difference between this 4 here and this 3
所以这4和这3之间的区别

219
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,470
here is important.
这很重要。 

220
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:19,336



221
00:10:19,336 --> 00:10:20,919
All right, anything else on Karatsuba?
好吧，唐津还有别的吗？ 

222
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:25,399



223
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:26,500
Cool.
凉。 

224
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,740
Let's talk about Newton.
让我们谈谈牛顿。 

225
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,149
That's the hard stuff.
那是很难的东西。 

226
00:10:30,149 --> 00:10:33,500
And let me see how we're doing on time.
让我看看我们的工作情况如何。 

227
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,287
OK, doing well.
好，做得好

228
00:10:35,287 --> 00:10:37,120
So does anyone remember the point of Newton?
有人记得牛顿的观点吗？ 

229
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:42,169



230
00:10:42,169 --> 00:10:44,589
OK, so I heard an application that
好，所以我听到一个应用程序

231
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:46,590
lets you compute square roots.
让您计算平方根。 

232
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:47,820
What else does it let you do?
它还能让您做什么？ 

233
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:52,559



234
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:54,250
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].
听众：[听不清]。 

235
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:57,684
PROFESSOR: OK, we have Karatsuba for multiplication.
教授：好的，我们有唐津乘法。 

236
00:10:57,684 --> 00:10:59,309
You might be able to do it with Newton.
您可能可以使用牛顿做到这一点。 

237
00:10:59,309 --> 00:11:00,739
Probably not going to be faster.
可能不会更快。 

238
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:03,609
But division, definitely.
但是，当然可以。 

239
00:11:03,809 --> 00:11:05,379
So square roots and division.
所以平方根和分裂。 

240
00:11:05,379 --> 00:11:07,990
So this is why we care about it.
因此，这就是我们关心它的原因。 

241
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:10,460
Now what does it do from a mathy perspective?
现在，从数学角度来看，它有什么作用？ 

242
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:13,379
So what's the mathy definition of Newton.
那么牛顿的数学定义是什么。 

243
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:15,355
AUDIENCE: Estimates--
听众：估计- 

244
00:11:15,355 --> 00:11:16,230
PROFESSOR: Estimates?
教授：估计吗？ 

245
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:17,120
AUDIENCE: The value--
听众：价值- 

246
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,001
PROFESSOR: OK.
教授：好的。 

247
00:11:18,001 --> 00:11:18,959
So, we have a function.
因此，我们有一个功能。 

248
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,269



249
00:11:22,269 --> 00:11:24,769
Suppose it looks like this.
假设它看起来像这样。 

250
00:11:24,769 --> 00:11:26,840
So, what Newton helps us do is it
因此，牛顿帮助我们做到的是

251
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,230
helps us find a root of the function.
帮助我们找到函数的根。 

252
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:37,990
And the root is a value x 0 so that f of x 0 equals 0.
根是值x 0，因此x 0的f等于0。 

253
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:38,859
So this is what it does.
这就是它的作用。 

254
00:11:39,059 --> 00:11:40,517
So when you want to use Newton, you
因此，当您想使用牛顿时， 

255
00:11:40,518 --> 00:11:42,639
have to set up your function in such a way
必须以这种方式设置您的功能

256
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:43,899
that your answer is a root.
你的答案是根。 

257
00:11:43,899 --> 00:11:52,669



258
00:11:52,669 --> 00:11:54,839
OK.
好。 

259
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,965
How does Newton work?
牛顿如何工作？ 

260
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:59,220



261
00:11:59,220 --> 00:11:59,720
Yes?
是？ 

262
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,984



263
00:12:02,184 --> 00:12:03,559
AUDIENCE: You start at some point
听众：从某个时候开始

264
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:05,267
where you actually know the answer to it,
你真正知道答案的地方， 

265
00:12:05,268 --> 00:12:08,461
and then you kind of draw a approximation.
然后您可以得出一个近似值

266
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:10,836
So you're just drawing a line from the point to the root,
因此，您只是在从点到根画一条线， 

267
00:12:10,836 --> 00:12:13,567
and then just incrementing down that line.
然后沿着那条线递增。 

268
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:14,149
PROFESSOR: OK.
教授：好的。 

269
00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:15,970
So we start at some point, right?
所以我们从某个时候开始吧？ 

270
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:17,580
How do we call that point?
我们怎么称呼这一点？ 

271
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,500
Initial guess.
初步猜测。 

272
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,360
Fancy name.
花式名字。 

273
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,980
So we have an initial guess for what the root might be.
因此，我们对根可能是一个初步的猜测。 

274
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,509
It's not going to be the right answer, because otherwise
这不是正确的答案，因为否则

275
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:26,717
why am I bothering with this?
我为什么要为此烦恼呢？ 

276
00:12:26,717 --> 00:12:28,118
But it can be too far off.
但这可能太遥远了。 

277
00:12:28,119 --> 00:12:29,459
We'll say that if you're too far off,
我们会说，如果您离得太远， 

278
00:12:29,659 --> 00:12:31,408
you're not going to converge or you're not
你不会收敛或者你不会

279
00:12:31,408 --> 00:12:32,870
going to converge fast enough.
会收敛得足够快。 

280
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:37,799
So say we start somewhere here and, we think, you know,
所以说我们从这里开始，我们认为，你知道， 

281
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:38,809
this is pretty close.
这非常接近。 

282
00:12:38,809 --> 00:12:41,159
It's not quite there, but it's pretty close.
它不完全存在，但是非常接近。 

283
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:43,049
What I do from here on is, you said
我从现在开始所做的是，你说

284
00:12:43,049 --> 00:12:45,735
I approximate this function--
我估计这个功能- 

285
00:12:45,735 --> 00:12:46,669
AUDIENCE: The line.
听众：这条线。 

286
00:12:46,669 --> 00:12:47,459
PROFESSOR: Yep.
教授：是的。 

287
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,214
So what's of the best line?
那么最好的路线是什么？ 

288
00:12:49,214 --> 00:12:50,679
The best way to approximate the function
近似函数的最佳方法

289
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:53,230
with the line is to use is the tangent, right?
用的线是切线，对吗？ 

290
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:57,129
So here, it sort of looks like this.
所以在这里，它看起来像这样。 

291
00:12:57,129 --> 00:12:58,689
And if the function were linear, this
如果函数是线性的，这

292
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,490
would be a perfect approximation and we'd
将是一个完美的近似值，我们会

293
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:02,791
get answer in one step.
一步就能得到答案。 

294
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:03,089
OK.
好。 

295
00:13:03,289 --> 00:13:04,399
So this is the tangent.
所以这就是切线。 

296
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,441
And then what we do with this tangent?
然后我们如何处理这个切线？ 

297
00:13:07,441 --> 00:13:09,281
AUDIENCE: Well, after we get the equation for it,
听众：嗯，我们得到方程式之后， 

298
00:13:09,481 --> 00:13:13,765
then we find the root, right?
那我们找到根了吧？ 

299
00:13:13,765 --> 00:13:14,766
Or no?
或者没有？ 

300
00:13:14,767 --> 00:13:16,850
PROFESSOR: Well, I can't find the root right away.
教授：好吧，我找不到马上的根源。 

301
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:17,730
AUDIENCE: The root of that line.
听众：那条线的根源。 

302
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:18,610
Of our tangent line.
我们的切线。 

303
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:19,192
PROFESSOR: OK.
教授：好的。 

304
00:13:19,192 --> 00:13:20,922
So we find the root of the tangent, which
所以我们找到切线的根

305
00:13:20,922 --> 00:13:22,504
is the point where it hits the x-axis.
是它撞击x轴的点。 

306
00:13:22,504 --> 00:13:25,230



307
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:28,604
And what happens with this point?
那么这会发生什么呢？ 

308
00:13:28,804 --> 00:13:30,739
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].
听众：[听不清]。 

309
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,710
PROFESSOR: OK, so this is our next guess.
教授：好的，这是我们的下一个猜测。 

310
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:33,460
And then we trade.
然后我们进行交易。 

311
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:37,100



312
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,990
So then we draw another tangent, and the idea
所以我们再画一条切线

313
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:41,299
is that eventually, you're going to get there.
最终，您将到达那里。 

314
00:13:41,299 --> 00:13:42,878
And if we go through the maths, we
如果我们通过数学，我们

315
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:44,719
will see that you actually get there pretty fast.
将会看到您实际上到达那里的速度非常快。 

316
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:47,879
So that's why we like this method.
这就是为什么我们喜欢这种方法。 

317
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:52,980
So let's see how we convert this drawing thing into an equation
因此，让我们看看如何将绘图内容转换为方程式

318
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,899
that you can write into python.
您可以将其写入python。 

319
00:13:54,899 --> 00:13:56,730
Let's label these quantities.
让我们标记这些数量。 

320
00:13:56,730 --> 00:14:01,493
So, x2, x1-- actually let's not use 1 and 2,
因此，x2，x1-实际上我们不使用1和2 

321
00:14:01,693 --> 00:14:03,360
because these are the first two guesses.
因为这是前两个猜测。 

322
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,830
Let's say our current guess is x and the next guess is x prime.
假设我们当前的猜测是x，下一个猜测是x素​​数。 

323
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:18,969
So this line and is x1 minus x, so this guy over here.
所以这行是x1减去x，所以这个家伙在这里。 

324
00:14:19,169 --> 00:14:20,469
And what's this guy over here?
那这个家伙是什么？ 

325
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:25,399



326
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:27,069
f of x.
 x的f。 

327
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:27,699
Don't be shy.
别害羞

328
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:29,329
It's the right answer.
这是正确的答案。 

329
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:33,840
So I have f of x here, x 1 minus x here.
所以我在这里有x的f，x是1减去x。 

330
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,750
I also have this angle here, and this angle here
我这里也有这个角度，这里也有这个角度

331
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,330
is the same angle as the angle here
与这里的角度相同

332
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:41,589
because both of these lines are horizontal,
因为这两条线都是水平的， 

333
00:14:41,789 --> 00:14:43,899
so they're parallel.
所以它们是平行的。 

334
00:14:43,899 --> 00:14:46,572
So what do I know about this angle?
那么我对这个角度了解多少呢？ 

335
00:14:46,572 --> 00:14:47,529
AUDIENCE: It's tangent.
听众：切线。 

336
00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:48,529
PROFESSOR: It's tangent.
教授：这是切线。 

337
00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:50,509



338
00:14:50,509 --> 00:14:51,080
OK.
好。 

339
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,889
The tangent, that's called the angle alpha.
切线，即角度Alpha。 

340
00:14:52,889 --> 00:14:56,169
What's the tangent of the angle?
角度的切线是多少？ 

341
00:14:56,169 --> 00:14:57,086
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].
听众：[听不清]。 

342
00:14:57,086 --> 00:15:02,279



343
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:04,279
PROFESSOR: Sorry?
教授：对不起？ 

344
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:07,939
AUDIENCE: F of x over x [INAUDIBLE].
观众：F x超过x [音频不清晰]。 

345
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,348



346
00:15:10,548 --> 00:15:12,340
PROFESSOR: I think you're trying to give me
教授：我想你是想给我

347
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,839
the formula for x prime.
 x素数的公式。 

348
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:15,969
Just the tangent.
只是切线。 

349
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:16,940
Just the tangent.
只是切线。 

350
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:20,735



351
00:15:20,735 --> 00:15:22,070
AUDIENCE: Oh.
听众：哦。 

352
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:24,629
PROFESSOR: Right?
教授：对吗？ 

353
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:25,769
Can someone reassure me?
有人可以安慰我吗？ 

354
00:15:25,769 --> 00:15:26,769
This is right, right?
是这样吧

355
00:15:26,769 --> 00:15:27,939
[AUDIENCE AGREES]
 [听众同意] 

356
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,786
AUDIENCE: I was thinking the slope of the line.
听众：我在想线的斜率。 

357
00:15:29,986 --> 00:15:30,569
PROFESSOR: OK.
教授：好的。 

358
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:31,980
So, yeah, you're going to give me

359
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,570
the slope of the line which lets me compute this.
线的斜率，让我可以计算出来。 

360
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:36,730
OK, I was looking for this.
好，我在找这个。 

361
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:37,230
OK.
好。 

362
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:39,229
So now, let's get what you're saying.
所以现在，让我们明白您的意思。 

363
00:15:39,429 --> 00:15:40,729
So this is the tangent, right?
这就是切线，对吗？ 

364
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:43,320



365
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,710
So, the tangent at a point of a function
因此，函数某点的切线

366
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:48,440
is the function's derivative.
是函数的导数。 

367
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,960
So now we're going to write all these things down and hope
所以现在我们要写下所有这些东西，并希望

368
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,740
that we get an equation that make sense.
我们得到了一个有意义的方程。 

369
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:58,730
So we have the tangent of this guy,
所以我们有这个人的切线， 

370
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:01,880
also happens to be this over this.
也恰好是这个。 

371
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,379
Right?
对？ 

372
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:06,830
This is a right angle triangle, so the tangent
这是一个直角三角形，所以切线

373
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:09,089
is f of x over-- this is what you
是x的f-这就是你

374
00:16:09,289 --> 00:16:11,889
were trying to tell me, right?
试图告诉我，对吧？ 

375
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:13,789
x1 minus x.
 x1减x。 

376
00:16:13,789 --> 00:16:16,980
So now I know that this is f prime of x.
所以现在我知道这是x的f素数。 

377
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:22,830



378
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:23,330
OK.
好。 

379
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:26,220



380
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:30,219
So, we look at the picture, we put in everything we know,
因此，我们查看图片，放入我们知道的所有内容， 

381
00:16:30,419 --> 00:16:32,419
and then we write an equation here.
然后在这里写一个方程式

382
00:16:32,419 --> 00:16:38,559
And we solve for-- sorry, this is x prime.
我们解决了-抱歉，这是x质数。 

383
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:40,719
So, if we solve for x prime, we're
所以，如果我们求解x素数， 

384
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,720
going to get x prime as a function of x.
将得到x素数作为x的函数。 

385
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,850
And this tells us, given a guess here,
这告诉我们，这里有一个猜测， 

386
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:48,855
how do we compute the next guess?
我们如何计算下一个猜测？ 

387
00:16:48,855 --> 00:16:50,230
So once we have an initial guess,
所以一旦有了初步的猜测， 

388
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:52,104
this lets us make the guess better and better
这让我们做出更好的猜测

389
00:16:52,104 --> 00:16:55,479
and better, closer and closer and closer to x0.
更好，越来越接近x0。 

390
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:58,859
So, let's solve this equation reasonably quickly.
因此，让我们合理快速地解决此方程。 

391
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:04,210



392
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:10,944
x prime minus x equals f prime of x over f of x, so
 x素数减x等于x的f之上的x的f素数，所以

393
00:17:10,944 --> 00:17:13,799
x prime is--
 x素数是- 

394
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:18,164
AUDIENCE: Does it matter if it's x minus x prime or [INAUDIBLE],
听众：是x减去x素数还是[听不清]， 

395
00:17:18,164 --> 00:17:20,269
because technically it's x minus x prime.
因为从技术上讲，它是x减x素数。 

396
00:17:20,269 --> 00:17:22,059
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it matters, because you're
教授：是的，很重要，因为您

397
00:17:22,059 --> 00:17:24,078
going to get the wrong sign.
会得到错误的信号。 

398
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:26,346
Which is exactly what I'm about to do here.
这正是我在这里要做的。 

399
00:17:26,346 --> 00:17:27,513
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.
听众：哦，好。 

400
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:29,429
PROFESSOR: So, I'm not going very well, right?
教授：所以，我做得不好，对吗？ 

401
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:35,859



402
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:36,659
This is wrong.
错了

403
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:40,887
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it's because you flipped your x at your prime--
听众：是的，因为您在素数时翻转了x 

404
00:17:41,087 --> 00:17:44,084
AUDIENCE: x minus x prime instead of x prime--
受众群体：x减x素数，而不是x素数- 

405
00:17:44,084 --> 00:17:46,500
AUDIENCE: No, I think it's because f prime of x is on top.
听众：不，我认为是因为x的素数在最前面。 

406
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,714
It should be on the bottom.
它应该在底部。 

407
00:17:47,714 --> 00:17:51,039
In the second-- no, third equation.
在第二个-不，第三个方程式中。 

408
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:52,464
Shouldn't those be flipped?
那些不应该被翻转吗？ 

409
00:17:52,464 --> 00:17:55,813
Because if you move the subtraction,
因为如果移动减法， 

410
00:17:55,814 --> 00:17:57,758
x prime to the left--
 x左边的素数

411
00:17:57,758 --> 00:18:03,104



412
00:18:03,104 --> 00:18:03,879
PROFESSOR: f what?
教授：什么？ 

413
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:06,576



414
00:18:06,576 --> 00:18:08,200
AUDIENCE: f of x over f minus x instead
观众：x的f超过f减去x 

415
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:12,380
of f prime x over f of x.
 f素数x的x超过x的f。 

416
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:15,476
Yeah, there you go.
是的，你去了。 

417
00:18:15,676 --> 00:18:17,009
PROFESSOR: OK, so I can do math.
教授：好的，我可以做数学。 

418
00:18:17,009 --> 00:18:18,150
OK, so that's one issue.
好，那是一个问题。 

419
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:18,909
There's one more issue.
还有一个问题。 

420
00:18:19,109 --> 00:18:21,379
So, there are too many issues here.
因此，这里有太多问题。 

421
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,400
Issue number one, this.
第一期，这个。 

422
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,229
Issue number two, I got this wrong.
第二期，我错了。 

423
00:18:26,229 --> 00:18:27,854
AUDIENCE: Oh, we get a negative number.
听众：哦，我们得到一个负数。 

424
00:18:27,854 --> 00:18:29,645
AUDIENCE: 2x minus x prime.
听众：2x减x素数。 

425
00:18:29,645 --> 00:18:30,269
PROFESSOR: Yep.
教授：是的。 

426
00:18:30,269 --> 00:18:32,384
So the reason for that is we're going--
所以这样做的原因是我们要- 

427
00:18:32,384 --> 00:18:34,509
AUDIENCE: Only if you start from the right, though.
听众：不过，只有从右开始。 

428
00:18:34,509 --> 00:18:35,175
PROFESSOR: Yeah.
教授：是的。 

429
00:18:35,175 --> 00:18:36,723
AUDIENCE: If you start from the left,
听众：如果您从左侧开始， 

430
00:18:36,723 --> 00:18:44,367
if your guess is to the left of the actual root,
如果您的猜测在实际词根的左侧， 

431
00:18:44,367 --> 00:18:47,076
it may or may not be different.
它可能不同也可能不同。 

432
00:18:47,076 --> 00:18:47,660
PROFESSOR: OK.
教授：好的。 

433
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:50,779
So our guess should be to the right.
因此，我们的猜测应该是正确的。 

434
00:18:50,779 --> 00:18:54,029



435
00:18:54,029 --> 00:18:58,180
So this is x minus x prime.
因此，这是x减去x质数。 

436
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,538
So the reason it's x minus x prime, the way you remember
所以它是x减x质数的原因，你记得的方式

437
00:19:00,538 --> 00:19:02,579
this and you don't do the same mistake that I did
这和你没有做我一样的错误

438
00:19:02,579 --> 00:19:05,909
is, you want to walk against the derivative.
是的，您想反对派生。 

439
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:07,849
If you walk in the direction of the derivative,
如果您沿导数方向走， 

440
00:19:08,049 --> 00:19:09,970
it's going to move you forward, right?
它将使您前进，对吗？ 

441
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:18,919
So, if you go in the direction of the derivative,
因此，如果您朝导数方向前进， 

442
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:21,579
instead of going backwards like this,
而不是像这样倒退

443
00:19:21,579 --> 00:19:24,000
you're going to go forward like this.
您将像这样前进。 

444
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,690
So you're going to go away from the solution.
因此，您将远离解决方案。 

445
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:32,119
So, this will take us in the right direction,
因此，这将带我们朝正确的方向前进， 

446
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:34,480
and this means that it's--
这意味着- 

447
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:52,049



448
00:19:52,049 --> 00:19:52,549
OK.
好。 

449
00:19:52,549 --> 00:19:53,690
So two ways to remember this.
有两种方法可以记住这一点。 

450
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:55,565
One that you're going against the derivative.
你反对派生的一种。 

451
00:19:55,565 --> 00:19:57,740
Another one is that you have your guess
另一个是你有自己的猜测

452
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,500
and you're subtracting something from it.
然后从中减去一些东西。 

453
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,059
AUDIENCE: You flipped your primes again.
听众：您再次翻转了素数。 

454
00:20:01,059 --> 00:20:01,349
PROFESSOR: Again?
教授：还是吗？ 

455
00:20:01,349 --> 00:20:01,849
Jesus.
耶稣。 

456
00:20:01,849 --> 00:20:03,333
[LAUGHTER]
 [笑声] 

457
00:20:03,334 --> 00:20:05,084
AUDIENCE: I mean, I agree, the prime looks
听众：我的意思是，我很赞

458
00:20:05,084 --> 00:20:08,096
better on top part of the fraction, but still.
在分数的顶部更好，但仍然如此。 

459
00:20:08,096 --> 00:20:08,680
PROFESSOR: OK.
教授：好的。 

460
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,980



461
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:15,190
Well clearly, my hand thinks the same thing.
很明显，我的手也有同样的想法。 

462
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:18,731
So this is you'd iterate using Newton.
因此，这是您要使用牛顿进行的迭代。 

463
00:20:18,731 --> 00:20:20,690
So the way to remember that the signs are right
所以记住标志正确的方法

464
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:22,298
is your x is somewhere here, and you
你的x在这里吗

465
00:20:22,298 --> 00:20:24,589
know you have to subtract something from it so it looks

466
00:20:24,589 --> 00:20:25,929
like this figure.
像这个数字。 

467
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:29,789
And this actually works in all the cases, turns out.
事实证明，这实际上适用于所有情况。 

468
00:20:29,789 --> 00:20:33,430



469
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:35,750
Our guesses are usually smaller than the actual number,
我们的猜测通常小于实际数字， 

470
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,509
and this still works.
这仍然有效。 

471
00:20:38,509 --> 00:20:40,390
OK, so let's go over Newton.
好，让我们来谈谈牛顿。 

472
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:42,639
What do we have, or what do we need in order
我们有什么，或者我们需要什么

473
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:45,279
to make Newton happen.
使牛顿发生。 

474
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:48,789
So we need to be able to evaluate this, right?

475
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:51,190
So we need to be able to evaluate

476
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:58,180
f over f prime of x for any x that Newton gives us.
对于牛顿给我们的任何x，f超过x的f素数。 

477
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:01,210
And for Newton, this is a black box.
对于牛顿来说，这是一个黑匣子。 

478
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:03,500
So whichever way you use to implement
因此，无论您采用哪种方式实施

479
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:07,279
this is fine, as long as it works reasonably fast.
只要它工作得相当快，就可以了。 

480
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:11,549
OK, what else do we need to use Newton.
好，我们还需要使用牛顿。 

481
00:21:11,549 --> 00:21:14,470
We need to remember this formula Let's start with something

00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:21,329
What do I need?
我需要什么？ 

486
00:21:21,329 --> 00:21:24,634



487
00:21:24,634 --> 00:21:26,679
AUDIENCE: You need a line, a tangent line
听众：您需要一条线，一条切线

488
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:27,950
like you did before.
像以前一样

489
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:30,730
PROFESSOR: Well, that's already taken care of here.

490
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:33,210
So we have this, and we know that we'll

491
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:36,000
have to compute this and plug it in here.

492
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,900
So, what do I need to compute a/b using Newton?
那么，我需要使用牛顿计算a / b吗？ 

493
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:59,500

So, I need the function, right?
所以，我需要功能，对吗？ 

495
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:03,789
This thing.
这东西。 

496
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:06,789
I can't say it's something, I have to figure out what it is.
我不能说这是什么，我必须弄清楚它是什么。 

497
00:22:06,789 --> 00:22:09,940
I guess I was confusing because I said assume we have this.
我想我很困惑，因为我说过假设我们有这个。 

498
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,788
Well, sorry.

00:22:12,996 --> 00:22:14,948
so we can evaluate this.
因此我们可以对此进行评估。 

502
00:22:15,148 --> 00:22:16,939
OK, so we need to come up with the function

503
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:19,649
so we can evaluate that, and what property

does the function need to meet?
功能需要满足吗？ 

505
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:22,589
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].
听众：[听不清]。 

506
00:22:22,589 --> 00:22:25,778



507
00:22:25,778 --> 00:22:27,569
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that would be nice, right?
教授：是的，那很好，对吗？ 

508
00:22:27,569 --> 00:22:34,980
So we want the function so that f of a/b equals 0,
因此，我们希望该函数使a / b的f等于0， 

509
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,759
because that's the number that Newton will give us.
因为那是牛顿给我们的电话。 

510
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:46,079
And we also need to be able to compute f over f prime of x
而且我们还需要能够计算x的f素数上的f

513
00:22:53,094 --> 00:22:54,759
OK, so the first thing we're going to do

514
00:22:54,759 --> 00:22:59,000
is we're going to simplify this problem to 1 over b instead

515
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,630
of a over b, because if you know what's 1 over b,
 a以上的b，因为如果您知道b以上的1， 

516
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:05,400
you're going to multiply this by a,
您将乘以a， 

517
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,160
and you're going to get a over b.
并且您将获得a以上的b。 

518
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,849



519
00:23:11,049 --> 00:23:13,480
Suppose we work with integers and we

00:23:22,309 --> 00:23:23,730
AUDIENCE: You shift it out, right?
听众：你把它移开了吧？ 

524
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:26,920
To get that 0.23, shift now to [INAUDIBLE].
要获得0.23，请立即移至[音频不清晰]。 

525
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,109
PROFESSOR: All right, all right.
教授：好的，好的。 

526
00:23:28,309 --> 00:23:30,149
So 1 over b.
所以1分以上

527
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:32,160
Unless b is 1, in which case it's really boring.
除非b为1，否则确实很无聊。 

528
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,339
1 over b looks like this.
 b上的1看起来像这样。 

529
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:38,409

right by d digits.
右边是d位数字。 

536
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:57,190
So instead of 0 point something, it's
所以不是0点的东西，而是

537
00:23:57,190 --> 00:24:00,650
d digits here point something else.
此处的d位数字指向其他内容。 

538
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:03,909

PROFESSOR: Multiply by 10 to the d.
教授：将d乘以10。 

541
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:12,829
So instead of computing 1 over b, 10 to the d over b.
因此，不是在b上计算1，而是在b上计算d的10。 

542
00:24:12,829 --> 00:24:18,210
And we call this 10 to the d R in our station notes.
我们将这10称为电台注释中的dR。 

543
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:24,419
So we're going to compute R. Over b multiplied

544
00:24:24,619 --> 00:24:31,189
by a, and then everything divided by R.
乘以a，然后除以R。 

545
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:33,150
So we talked about how you multiply

546
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:36,879
by R. How do you divide by R?
用R划分。如何除以R？ 

547
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:39,230
So, if I have a number with n digits
所以，如果我有一个n位数字

548
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:44,875
and I want to divide by 10 to the d, how do I do that?

550
00:24:46,126 --> 00:24:47,085
PROFESSOR: Shift right.
教授：向右移动。 

551
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:48,829
If the number is a python list?
如果数字是python列表？ 

552
00:24:48,829 --> 00:24:53,448



553
00:24:53,449 --> 00:24:54,240
AUDIENCE: Slice it.
听众：切成薄片。 

554
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,018
PROFESSOR: Yep.
教授：是的。 

555
00:24:55,018 --> 00:24:56,730
So kill the last d digits.
因此，杀死最后的d位数字。 

556
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:58,849
So, if I add d digits to the right,
因此，如果我在右侧添加d位数字， 

557
00:24:58,849 --> 00:25:00,709
I multiply by 10 to the d.
我乘以10到d。 

558
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:04,289
If I slice the last digits, I divide by 10 to the d.
如果我将最后几位切成片，则将10除以d。 

559
00:25:04,289 --> 00:25:08,690
So this is division, this is multiplication.
所以这是除法，这是乘法。 

560
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:11,769
And the reason I care about that is this
我关心这个的原因是

561
00:25:11,769 --> 00:25:16,894
is going to be an easy division, and whenever I have this,

So, f prime of x over--
因此，x的f素数- 

574
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:00,807
AUDIENCE: I think you switched it again.
听众：我想你又改了。 

575
00:26:00,807 --> 00:26:01,986
[LAUGHTER]
 [笑声] 

576
00:26:01,986 --> 00:26:02,659
PROFESSOR: Thank you.
教授：谢谢。 

577
00:26:02,859 --> 00:26:06,529
Because I was running ahead, and I was like, OK, this works.
因为我正在向前奔跑，所以我想，这行得通。 

578
00:26:06,529 --> 00:26:07,879
Why does it work?
为什么行得通？ 

579
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:12,563
OK, so this is going to be x minus R over b, right?
好吧，所以这将是x减去b的R吧？ 

580
00:26:12,763 --> 00:26:13,679
Can you evaluate this?
你能评价一下吗？ 

581
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,660

00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:19,134
If I can't evaluate this, I already know the answer.
如果我无法对此进行评估，我已经知道答案了。 

583
00:26:19,134 --> 00:26:23,394



584
00:26:23,394 --> 00:26:26,650
AUDIENCE: Your prime's not on the bottom one.
听众：您的素数不在最底端。 

585
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:29,130
PROFESSOR: So, it's x minus this divided by 1.
教授：因此，x减去此除以1。 

586
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:30,084
So, it's this.
所以，就是这个。 

587
00:26:30,084 --> 00:26:32,500
So then, if you're trying to evaluate this far the guesses
因此，如果您要对此进行评估，那么猜测

588
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:36,200
that Newton gives you, you can't.
牛顿给你的，你不能。 

589
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,720
Because if you could, you'd have the answer already.
因为如果可以的话，您已经有了答案。 

590
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,339
So we can't use this function.
因此，我们无法使用此功能。 

591
00:26:40,339 --> 00:26:43,009
This is a nice and easy function that doesn't work.
这是一个很好的简单功能，无法正常工作。 

592
00:26:43,009 --> 00:26:45,730
So while I erase the board, one minute, someone

593
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:46,980
figure out the right function.
找出正确的功能。 

594
00:26:46,980 --> 00:27:05,920

603
00:27:21,819 --> 00:27:28,240
let's try this 1/x minus b/R. And the intuition behind this
让我们试试这个1 / x减去b / R。而这背后的直觉

Next thing, I bring this guy under the denominator,
接下来，我把这个家伙带到分母的下面， 

743
00:34:08,019 --> 00:34:16,539
so it's 3x cubed minus x cubed plus a over 3x squared.
因此是3倍的立方减去x的立方，再加上3倍的平方。 

744
00:34:16,539 --> 00:34:23,250
So it's 2x cubed plus a over 3x squared.

I have to be able to say whether this is too small, too big,
我必须说这是太小还是太大， 

894
00:40:51,639 --> 00:40:54,819
or just the right number.
或正确的号码。 

895
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:58,500
So given a guess, I can multiply it by itself three times,
因此，我可以将其自身乘以三倍， 

896
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:59,000
right?
对？ 

897
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,400
Compute gets cubed.
计算得到立方体。 

898
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:04,210
And I can see how does it compare to the number
我可以看到它与数字相比如何

899
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:04,780
that I want.
我想要的。 

900
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:14,690



901
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:17,554
So I have the first digit, and I have an order of magnitude.
所以我有第一个数字，并且有一个数量级。 

902
00:41:17,554 --> 00:41:20,739



903
00:41:20,739 --> 00:41:23,329
Not bad, right?
还不错吧？ 

904
00:41:23,329 --> 00:41:25,150
Pretty good initial guess.
很好的初步猜测。 

905
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:27,389
This is as much of an answer is you need to give out
这就是答案，您需要给出答案

906
00:41:27,389 --> 00:41:31,609
in physics problems, and you get full score, so that's good.
在物理问题上，您会得到满分，所以这很好。 

907
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:33,920



908
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:35,949
OK, how are we doing so far?
好，到目前为止我们怎么样？ 

909
00:41:35,949 --> 00:41:37,669
Following along?
跟着呢？ 

910
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:40,692
AUDIENCE: If we compute our guess cubed,
观众：如果我们计算出立方的猜测， 

911
00:41:40,891 --> 00:41:43,723
we want only to compare it to our original number
我们只想将其与原始号码进行比较

912
00:41:43,724 --> 00:41:44,987
to see how close it is?
看它有多近？ 

913
00:41:44,987 --> 00:41:45,612
PROFESSOR: Yup.
教授：是的。 

914
00:41:45,612 --> 00:41:49,336
AUDIENCE: And, do we just keep on doing that until--
听众：而且，我们是否继续这样做直到- 

915
00:41:49,336 --> 00:41:51,920
PROFESSOR: Well, so you're going have to guess a digit, right?
教授：好吧，所以您将不得不猜测一个数字，对吧？ 

916
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,000
Between 0 and 2 to the 16.
在0到2到16之间。 

917
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,119
So you choose the largest thing that's smaller than your guess,
因此，您选择比您的猜测小的最大的东西， 

918
00:41:58,119 --> 00:41:58,759
or something.
或者其他的东西。 

919
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,760
AUDIENCE: Or until we get the first digit.
听众：或者直到我们得到第一个数字。 

920
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:00,594
PROFESSOR: Yeah.
教授：是的。 

921
00:42:00,793 --> 00:42:01,504
Just the first.
只是第一个。 

922
00:42:01,505 --> 00:42:03,380
And then you have a first digit, and then you
然后你有第一个数字，然后你

923
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:04,704
have an order of magnitude.
有一个数量级

924
00:42:04,704 --> 00:42:06,079
And then you feed that to Newton,
然后把它喂给牛顿， 

925
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:07,275
which converges way faster.
收敛速度更快。 

926
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:09,605



927
00:42:09,804 --> 00:42:11,929
So you could the binary search for the whole thing,
因此，您可以对整个内容进行二进制搜索， 

928
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:14,639
but that would be slower than Newton, turns out.
但事实证明，这将比牛顿慢。 

929
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:15,739
Yes?
是？ 

930
00:42:15,739 --> 00:42:18,899
AUDIENCE: So where'd you get the f of x here?
听众：那么你在哪里得到x的f？ 

931
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,320
I'm missing that stuff.
我想念那些东西。 

932
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,000
PROFESSOR: Oh.
教授：哦。 

933
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,760
AUDIENCE: Yeah, right there.
听众：是的，就在那里。 

934
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:26,550
PROFESSOR: Someone told me to use this.
教授：有人告诉我使用这个。 

935
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:29,539
[LAUGHTER]
 [笑声] 

936
00:42:29,539 --> 00:42:33,710
One of you guys told me to use this.
你们中的一个告诉我要使用它。 

937
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:34,780
Well, so I tried it out.
好吧，所以我尝试了一下。 

938
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:35,840
I put it here.
我把它放在这里。 

939
00:42:36,039 --> 00:42:38,110
And then I computed the derivative,
然后我计算了导数

940
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:40,547
and I looked to see if this looks reasonable.
我看这看起来是否合理。 

941
00:42:40,746 --> 00:42:42,579
And this looks like something I can compute.
这看起来像我可以计算的东西。 

942
00:42:42,579 --> 00:42:44,549
AUDIENCE: And why was that reasonable?
听众：那为什么合理呢？ 

943
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:46,150
PROFESSOR: Because I know how to do the division
教授：因为我知道该怎么做

944
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:46,740
and multiplication.
和乘法。 

945
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:49,869



946
00:42:49,869 --> 00:42:52,889
So, say if I would have had the square root of 3 in here,
因此，假设我在这里具有3的平方根， 

947
00:42:52,889 --> 00:42:55,699
that wouldn't be reasonable, right?
那是不合理的，对吧？ 

948
00:42:55,699 --> 00:42:56,439
Just like before.
就像以前那样。 

949
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,065
When you're trying to compute division,
当您尝试计算除法时， 

950
00:42:58,065 --> 00:42:59,317
we can't have division.
我们不能分裂。 

951
00:42:59,317 --> 00:43:00,900
If you're trying to compute sine of x,
如果您要计算x的正弦， 

952
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:03,519
you don't want to have sine of x.
您不想有x的正弦。 

953
00:43:03,719 --> 00:43:04,569
AUDIENCE: OK.
听众：好的。 

954
00:43:04,570 --> 00:43:07,920
and computing a over x squared is reasonable?
和计算一个x平方是否合理？ 

955
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:09,659
PROFESSOR: Because we did it before.
教授：因为我们以前做过。 

956
00:43:09,659 --> 00:43:10,000
AUDIENCE: OK.
听众：好的。 

957
00:43:10,199 --> 00:43:11,819
So then you might use something else, maybe?
那么，您可能还会使用其他东西吗？ 

958
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:12,190
PROFESSOR: Yeah.
教授：是的。 

959
00:43:12,389 --> 00:43:14,730
You can use something else as long as you know how to do it,
您可以使用其他方法，只要您知道该怎么做， 

960
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:16,230
and as long as it's reasonably fast.
并且只要它相当快。 

961
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:17,976
AUDIENCE: OK.
听众：好的。 

962
00:43:17,976 --> 00:43:18,599
PROFESSOR: Yes?
教授：是吗？ 

963
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:19,516
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].
听众：[听不清]。 

964
00:43:19,516 --> 00:43:24,650



965
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:25,900
PROFESSOR: Oh, no that's fine.
教授：哦，那很好。 

966
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:27,210
AUDIENCE: Oh, that fine?
听众：哦，好吗？ 

967
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:27,751
OK.
好。 

968
00:43:27,751 --> 00:43:29,210
PROFESSOR: So, the binary search is
教授：因此，二进制搜索是

969
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:30,840
fine to get the first approximation.
可以得到第一近似值。 

970
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,289
But after that-- so I'm not going
但是之后-所以我不去

971
00:43:32,289 --> 00:43:35,139
to do a binary search for the whole result,
对整个结果进行二进制搜索， 

972
00:43:35,139 --> 00:43:38,239
because Newton is faster than that.
因为牛顿比那快。 

973
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:40,519
I'm just using this so that I have a decent guess
我只是用这个，所以我有一个不错的猜测

974
00:43:40,519 --> 00:43:42,110
to pass to Newton.
传递给牛顿。 

975
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:46,960
And we'll see why we need that decent guess in two minutes
我们将在两分钟内看到为什么我们需要这样的猜测

976
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,494
total.
总。 

977
00:43:48,494 --> 00:43:50,619
So I'm going to try to spend two minutes to explain
所以我将尝试花两分钟来解释

978
00:43:50,619 --> 00:43:52,829
how the error thing works, and you'll
错误是如何工作的，您将

979
00:43:52,829 --> 00:43:55,059
have to look at the notes and make sense out
必须看一下笔记并弄清楚

980
00:43:55,059 --> 00:43:58,130
of the rest of it.
其余的。 

981
00:43:58,130 --> 00:43:59,144
So, let's see.
所以，让我们看看。 

982
00:43:59,344 --> 00:43:59,844
Errors.
错误。 

983
00:43:59,844 --> 00:44:07,359



984
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:10,260
So with Newton, you start to with an initial guess,
因此，对于牛顿，您首先要进行初步猜测， 

985
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:12,570
and then you get to a better guess, and a better
然后你会得到一个更好的猜测，一个更好的

986
00:44:12,570 --> 00:44:16,019
guess, and a better guess, and so on and so forth
猜测，更好的猜测，依此类推

987
00:44:16,219 --> 00:44:17,534
until you're satisfied.
直到您满意为止。 

988
00:44:17,534 --> 00:44:19,784
By the way, if we're doing this one, are we satisfied?
顺便说一句，如果我们正在这样做，我们是否满意？ 

989
00:44:19,784 --> 00:44:23,789



990
00:44:23,789 --> 00:44:25,956
AUDIENCE: What do you mean, like, finding the guess?
听众：寻找猜测是什么意思？ 

991
00:44:25,956 --> 00:44:26,480
Are we satisfied?
我们满意吗？ 

992
00:44:26,679 --> 00:44:27,429
PROFESSOR: Oh, no.
教授：哦，不。 

993
00:44:27,429 --> 00:44:28,789
So, we have the initial guess.
因此，我们有了初步的猜测。 

994
00:44:28,789 --> 00:44:33,279
And we keep applying the formula that I just deleted to iterate.
而且，我们继续应用刚刚删除的公式进行迭代。 

995
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,400
When do we stop?
我们什么时候停止？ 

996
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,670
AUDIENCE: When we have enough digits of precision?
听众：什么时候我们有足够的精度？ 

997
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:38,659
PROFESSOR: So how do we know when we have enough digits,
教授：那我们怎么知道什么时候有足够的数字， 

998
00:44:38,659 --> 00:44:39,949
if we're working with integers?
如果我们使用整数？ 

999
00:44:39,949 --> 00:44:41,909
AUDIENCE: We iterate again and nothing changes.
听众：我们再次进行迭代，没有任何变化。 

1000
00:44:41,909 --> 00:44:44,009
PROFESSOR: We iterate again and nothing changes.
教授：我们再次进行了迭代，没有任何变化。 

1001
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:47,692
So I'm computing-- do I have this anywhere?
所以我在计算-我到处都有吗？ 

1002
00:44:47,891 --> 00:44:49,029
Oh, no.
不好了。 

1003
00:44:49,030 --> 00:44:49,980
I erased it.
我删除了。 

1004
00:44:50,179 --> 00:44:54,139
So I'm computing 10 t0 some-- oh, I had it up here.
所以我正在计算10 t0-哦，我在这里。 

1005
00:44:54,139 --> 00:44:55,730
So, I'm computing 10 to the power
所以，我正在计算10 

1006
00:44:55,730 --> 00:44:59,630
of d times a square root of 3, because I
 d乘以3的平方根，因为我

1007
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:00,800
want to work with integers.
想使用整数。 

1008
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,730
Just integers.
只是整数。 

1009
00:45:03,730 --> 00:45:04,809
I used Newton to iterate.
我用牛顿来迭代。 

1010
00:45:04,809 --> 00:45:08,250
My precision gets gets better and better and better.
我的精度越来越好。 

1011
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:09,150
And I use integers.
我使用整数。 

1012
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:10,860
So I only have d digits of precision.
所以我只有d位精度。 

1013
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:14,510
Everything after that gets discarded automatically.
之后的所有内容都会自动丢弃。 

1014
00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:17,516
When I get 2 x's that don't change-- so if I get x5,
当我得到2 x时，它不会改变-因此，如果我得到x5， 

1015
00:45:17,516 --> 00:45:18,889
and then I run the thing and then
然后我跑东西，然后

1016
00:45:18,889 --> 00:45:22,529
I get x6 that is equal to x5, there's
我得到的x6等于x5，有

1017
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:24,519
no point to keep running Newton, right?
没必要继续跑牛顿吧？ 

1018
00:45:24,519 --> 00:45:25,108
I;m stuck.
我被困住了。 

1019
00:45:25,108 --> 00:45:26,900
And I'm also done because I have the answer
而且我也完成了，因为我有答案

1020
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:28,650
with d digits of precision.
精度为d位。 

1021
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:30,262
So this is where I stop.
所以这是我停下来的地方。 

1022
00:45:30,262 --> 00:45:34,231



1023
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:34,730
OK.
好。 

1024
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:38,389
Now, my precision is how far I am from the right answer.
现在，我的精度是我离正确答案有多远。 

1025
00:45:38,389 --> 00:45:40,750
And we write that by saying that x1
我们说x1 

1026
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:47,769
is x, the true answer, times 1 plus epsilon, epsilon 1.
是x，是真正的答案，乘以1加epsilon，epsilon 1。 

1027
00:45:47,769 --> 00:45:55,119
And then x2 is x times 1 plus epsilon 2, 1 plus epsilon 3,
然后x2是x乘以1加epsilon 2、1加epsilon 3， 

1028
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:58,480
so on and so forth.
等等等等。 

1029
00:45:58,480 --> 00:45:59,039
Right?
对？ 

1030
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:03,670
So, if we had a lot of time and not too much stuff to do,
因此，如果我们有很多时间，没有太多事情要做， 

1031
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:06,829
I could copy this thing here that we have in the notes.
我可以在笔记中复制此内容。 

1032
00:46:06,829 --> 00:46:09,210
That's eight lines of math.
那是八行数学。 

1033
00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:15,920
And then we'd get something along the lines of x of i
然后我们将得到与x相似的东西

1034
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:24,460
plus 1 is x times 1 plus something times E
加1是x乘1加某事乘E 

1035
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:31,840
squared-- I'm sorry, Ei squared.
平方-对不起，Ei平方。 

1036
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:39,900
So this is also 1 plus Ei plus 1.
所以这也是1加Ei加1。 

1037
00:46:40,099 --> 00:46:47,219
So what we get is that E of i plus 1 is roughly E i squared.
所以我们得到的是，我的E加1大约等于我的平方。 

1038
00:46:47,219 --> 00:46:52,619



1039
00:46:52,619 --> 00:46:57,809
And this is what's really called quadratic convergence.
这就是所谓的二次收敛。 

1040
00:46:57,809 --> 00:46:59,690
Now why is this good?
现在为什么这么好？ 

1041
00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:02,920
Can anyone think intuitively why this is nice?
任何人都可以凭直觉思考为什么这很好吗？ 

1042
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:03,659
In which cases?
在什么情况下？ 

1043
00:47:03,659 --> 00:47:04,579
Yes?
是？ 

1044
00:47:04,579 --> 00:47:07,150
AUDIENCE: You're converging really quickly to your answer.
听众：您很快就可以收敛自己的答案。 

1045
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:08,099
PROFESSOR: OK.
教授：好的。 

1046
00:47:08,099 --> 00:47:10,404
But when do I converge?
但是我什么时候收敛？ 

1047
00:47:10,405 --> 00:47:12,257
, So what I want this to happen?
 ，那么我希望这种情况发生吗？ 

1048
00:47:12,257 --> 00:47:13,340
What do I want this to be?
我希望这是什么？ 

1049
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:14,056
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].
听众：[听不清]。 

1050
00:47:14,255 --> 00:47:17,196



1051
00:47:17,197 --> 00:47:19,030
PROFESSOR: Well, you guys told me everything
教授：嗯，你们都告诉我了一切

1052
00:47:19,030 --> 00:47:21,400
I need for the next two minutes.
接下来的两分钟我需要。 

1053
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:25,880
So, I want this to become 1, right?
所以，我希望这个变成1，对不对？ 

1054
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:31,170
This has to go to 1 because I want this whole thing to be x.
这必须设为1，因为我希望整个东西都是x。 

1055
00:47:31,170 --> 00:47:35,539
So in order for this to be 1, I want to epsilons to go to 0.
因此，为了使它为1，我想将epsilons设置为0。 

1056
00:47:35,739 --> 00:47:38,139
So I want them to be as small as possible.
所以我希望它们尽可能小。 

1057
00:47:38,139 --> 00:47:42,469
Now, you said that if my epsilon is smaller than 1,
现在，您说如果我的ε小于1， 

1058
00:47:42,469 --> 00:47:48,399
then epsilon squared is smaller than epsilon.
那么epsilon平方小于epsilon。 

1059
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,940
And intuitively, how this works is,
从直觉上讲，这是如何工作的， 

1060
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:54,159
suppose you start with an epsilon of 0.1.
假设您的epsilon为0.1。 

1061
00:47:54,159 --> 00:47:58,289
When you square it, you get 0.01.
平方时，得到0.01。 

1062
00:47:58,289 --> 00:48:02,259
You square it again, you get 0.0001.
再次平方，得到0.0001。 

1063
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:02,880
Square it again.
再次平方。 

1064
00:48:03,079 --> 00:48:08,699
0.00000001.
 0.00000001。 

1065
00:48:08,699 --> 00:48:09,199
OK.
好。 

1066
00:48:09,199 --> 00:48:12,329
This is step 0, step 1, step 2, step 3.
这是步骤0，步骤1，步骤2，步骤3。 

1067
00:48:12,329 --> 00:48:13,980
How many digits do I have here?
我这里有几位数？ 

1068
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:18,039



1069
00:48:18,239 --> 00:48:20,697
Don't be shy.
别害羞

1070
00:48:20,697 --> 00:48:22,179
AUDIENCE: 2 to the i?
听众：2到i？ 

1071
00:48:22,179 --> 00:48:22,809
PROFESSOR: Yup.
教授：是的。 

1072
00:48:22,809 --> 00:48:23,674
2 to the i.
 2到i。 

1073
00:48:23,675 --> 00:48:28,500



1074
00:48:28,699 --> 00:48:31,460
So this is going to be equal to this
所以这将等于

1075
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:40,019
when 1 plus x times 1 plus epsilon i over 1 plus epsilon--
当1加x乘以1加epsilon我超过1加epsilon-- 

1076
00:48:40,219 --> 00:48:48,019
sorry, i plus 1 epsilon i when the floor of this thing
抱歉，我加上1 epsilon我在地板上

1077
00:48:48,019 --> 00:48:53,800
is-- sorry, there is a delta somewhere here.
是-抱歉，这儿有一个三角洲。 

1078
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:57,210
So, something has to converge to 0.
因此，某些东西必须收敛到0。 

1079
00:48:57,210 --> 00:49:00,329



1080
00:49:00,329 --> 00:49:03,210
Sorry, this is what it is.
抱歉，就是这样。 

1081
00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:06,110
1 plus e of i.
 i的1加e。 

1082
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:10,210



1083
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:14,309
So this is the difference between two terms, x.
这就是两个项x的差。 

1084
00:49:14,309 --> 00:49:16,737
So this is x6 minus x5, right?
所以这是x6减去x5，对吧？ 

1085
00:49:16,737 --> 00:49:20,849



1086
00:49:20,849 --> 00:49:23,331
Convincing?
有说服力吗？ 

1087
00:49:23,331 --> 00:49:24,769
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].
听众：[听不清]。 

1088
00:49:24,769 --> 00:49:25,978
Let's write it again.
让我们再写一次。 

1089
00:49:25,978 --> 00:49:26,853
Let's write it again.
让我们再写一次。 

1090
00:49:26,853 --> 00:49:27,686
This is out of hand.
这是失控的。 

1091
00:49:27,686 --> 00:49:30,380
So, x, x minus x5, or actually, xi
因此，x，x减去x5，或者实际上是xi 

1092
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:37,900
plus 1 minus xi is equal to x times 1 plus epsilon i
加1减xi等于x乘以1加epsilon i 

1093
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:43,389
plus 1 minus x times 1 plus epsilon i, right?
加1减x乘1加epsilon i，对吗？ 

1094
00:49:43,389 --> 00:49:48,638
So this is x times-- Sorry?
这是x次了-对不起？ 

1095
00:49:48,639 --> 00:49:49,846
AUDIENCE: Those are xi, x of i.
听众：那是xi，i的x。 

1096
00:49:50,045 --> 00:49:53,699
AUDIENCE: No, those are the real x's.
听众：不，那是真实的x。 

1097
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:56,919
PROFESSOR: These are-- so these are the approximations,
教授：这些是近似值， 

1098
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:59,153
but then, this is the real x.
但这就是真实的x 

1099
00:49:59,153 --> 00:50:00,570
AUDIENCE: I understand, thank you.
听众：我明白，谢谢。 

1100
00:50:00,570 --> 00:50:00,952
PROFESSOR: OK.
教授：好的。 

1101
00:50:01,152 --> 00:50:04,609
So, this is, the difference between them is this guy here.
所以，这是他们之间的区别是这个人。 

1102
00:50:04,610 --> 00:50:12,230
So if I take the floor because I work with integers,
因此，如果我因为使用​​整数而发言， 

1103
00:50:12,429 --> 00:50:16,699
when this floor becomes 0, we're done, right?
当该楼层变为0时，我们完成了，对吗？ 

1104
00:50:16,699 --> 00:50:18,969
So in order for the floor to become 0,
因此，为了使下限变为0， 

1105
00:50:18,969 --> 00:50:23,399
this guy has to be canceled by this guy.
这个人必须被这个人取消。 

1106
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:27,300
So this guy has some number of digits, whatever that is.
所以这个家伙有一些数字，无论是多少。 

1107
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:31,260
It's my number with d digits of precision.
这是我的数字，精度为d位。 

1108
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:35,980
Well, that's OK because-- where my 0s?
好吧，那没关系，因为-我的0在哪里？ 

1109
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:36,789
Did I erase my 0s?
我是否擦除了0？ 

1110
00:50:36,789 --> 00:50:37,590
Oh, no.
不好了。 

1111
00:50:37,590 --> 00:50:39,940
I have 0s here, right?
我这里有0，对吧？ 

1112
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:41,539
The epsilons have a lot of 0s in them,
 epsilons中有很多0， 

1113
00:50:41,739 --> 00:50:46,109
so the 0s are going to cancel the digits in x.
因此0将取消x中的数字。 

1114
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:52,980
So as soon as I have enough 0s here to cancel this, I'm stuck.
因此，只要我在这里有足够的0来取消此设置，我就会被卡住。 

1115
00:50:53,179 --> 00:50:59,039
The number of 0s increases exponentially.
 0的数量呈指数增加。 

1116
00:50:59,039 --> 00:51:02,309
So in each step the number of 0s I have doubles.
因此，在每一步中，0的数量都会加倍。 

1117
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:06,880
So after log d steps, I'm done.
因此，在完成d步骤之后，我就完成了。 

1118
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,500
If I have d digits in here, because I'm
如果我在这里有d位数字，因为我

1119
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:12,189
computing this with d digits of precision,
用d位精度进行计算

1120
00:51:12,190 --> 00:51:15,650
after roughly log d steps, I'll have enough 0s here
经过大致的记录d步骤，我这里将有足够的0 

1121
00:51:15,650 --> 00:51:17,750
to reduce this and make the whole thing be 0.
减少这个并使整个东西为0。 

1122
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:20,769



1123
00:51:20,769 --> 00:51:23,420
So this is how I know that it's fast.
这就是我所知道的快速的方式。 

1124
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:27,730
So in the end, what you want is the initial guess
所以最后，您想要的是最初的猜测

1125
00:51:27,730 --> 00:51:30,440
has to satisfy this, and then you
必须满足这个，然后你

1126
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:36,659
want to be able to prove that this is true.
希望能够证明这是真的。 

1127
00:51:36,659 --> 00:51:39,129
So you want this factor here that tells you you're
所以你想要这个因素告诉你

1128
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:40,900
converging fast.
快速收敛。 

1129
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:43,280
So when you look at the recitation notes
所以当你看背诵笔记时

1130
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:46,173
and you look at this long string of equations,
然后看一长串方程， 

1131
00:51:46,373 --> 00:51:47,789
make sure this is somewhere there,
确保这是在那里

1132
00:51:47,789 --> 00:51:50,630
because this means you're on the right track.
因为这意味着您走在正确的轨道上。 

1133
00:51:50,630 --> 00:51:51,480
Yes?
是？ 

1134
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:52,940
AUDIENCE: If it takes log d steps,
听众：如果需要log d步骤， 

1135
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:56,959
doesn't the binary search also take log-- ah, OK.
二进制搜索是否也需要日志-啊，好的。 

1136
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:57,929
Log 10 steps.
记录10个步骤。 

1137
00:51:57,929 --> 00:51:58,429
Got it.
得到它了。 

1138
00:51:58,429 --> 00:51:59,029
PROFESSOR: Yeah.
教授：是的。 

1139
00:51:59,030 --> 00:51:59,360
Which is d.
 d。 

1140
00:51:59,559 --> 00:52:02,317



1141
00:52:02,317 --> 00:52:04,150
AUDIENCE: He's talking about binary search--
听众：他在谈论二进制搜索- 

1142
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:05,250
PROFESSOR: Oh, for one digit.
教授：哦，一位。 

1143
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:05,539
Yeah.
是的

1144
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:06,039
Oh, sorry.
哦对不起。 

1145
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:07,710
I thought you meant for the whole thing.
我以为你是整个意思。 

1146
00:52:07,710 --> 00:52:11,019
So if you wanted to do binary search for the whole thing,
因此，如果您想对整个内容进行二进制搜索， 

1147
00:52:11,019 --> 00:52:13,199
that's log of the whole number.
那是整数的对数。 

1148
00:52:13,199 --> 00:52:15,419
So that's order d where d is the number of digits.
所以是d的顺序，其中d是位数。 

1149
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:18,260



1150
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:20,422
AUDIENCE: Wait, he's talking about a binary [INAUDIBLE].
听众：等等，他在说二进制文件[听不清]。 

1151
00:52:20,621 --> 00:52:22,349
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].
听众：[听不清]。 

1152
00:52:22,349 --> 00:52:26,719
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] wants to go for [INAUDIBLE], 10
观众：[听不清]想参加[听不清]，10 

1153
00:52:26,719 --> 00:52:28,059
to the 20th.
到20日

1154
00:52:28,059 --> 00:52:30,489
He wants to do a binary search over like a cube root--
他想像立方根一样进行二进制搜索- 

1155
00:52:30,489 --> 00:52:31,629
PROFESSOR: So, for this?
教授：那么，为此吗？ 

1156
00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:33,309
Binary search for this or for one digit?
二进制搜索这个还是一位？ 

1157
00:52:33,309 --> 00:52:36,005
Or binary search to compute the cube root?
还是二进制搜索来计算立方根？ 

1158
00:52:36,005 --> 00:52:37,030
AUDIENCE: I think, yeah.
听众：我认为，是的。 

1159
00:52:37,030 --> 00:52:39,630
PROFESSOR: So, if you do that, your entire thing is
教授：所以，如果您这样做，您的整个工作就是

1160
00:52:39,630 --> 00:52:40,980
d digits, right?
 d位，对吗？ 

1161
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:42,860
So 10 to the d.
所以10到d。 

1162
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:45,609
Binary search takes log of 10 to the d.
二进制搜索将10的对数记为d。 

1163
00:52:45,610 --> 00:52:48,070
AUDIENCE: Right, yeah.
听众：对，是的。 

1164
00:52:48,070 --> 00:52:49,570
PROFESSOR: So the numbers that we're
教授：所以我们的数字

1165
00:52:49,570 --> 00:52:51,690
dealing with are d digits.
处理的是d位数字。 

1166
00:52:51,690 --> 00:52:53,929
So this d is the number of digits, not the number
所以这个d是位数，而不是数字

1167
00:52:53,929 --> 00:52:54,918
that you have.
你有。 

1168
00:52:54,918 --> 00:52:56,710
So if you look at the number that you have,
因此，如果您查看所拥有的号码， 

1169
00:52:56,710 --> 00:52:58,125
this is log log n.
这是日志日志n。 

1170
00:52:58,125 --> 00:53:00,228
AUDIENCE: Right, that makes sense.
听众：对，这很有道理。 

1171
00:53:00,228 --> 00:53:00,728
Sorry.
抱歉。 

1172
00:53:00,728 --> 00:53:02,632
PROFESSOR: So, it's faster.
教授：所以，它更快。 

1173
00:53:02,632 --> 00:53:03,590
AUDIENCE: I like it.
听众：我喜欢。 

1174
00:53:03,590 --> 00:53:04,507
It is faster.
它更快。 

1175
00:53:04,507 --> 00:53:05,090
PROFESSOR: OK.
教授：好的。 

1176
00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:05,190
Cool.
凉。 

1177
00:53:05,389 --> 00:53:06,306
Thanks for the lesson.
感谢您的教训。 

1178
00:53:06,306 --> 00:53:11,306
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].
听众：[听不清]。
