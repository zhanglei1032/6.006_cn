9
00:00:17,881 --> 00:00:27,000



10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,980
PROFESSOR: So we're going to do a problem that
教授：所以我们要解决一个问题

11
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,129
looks like the guitar problem.
看起来像吉他问题。 

12
00:00:30,329 --> 00:00:31,911
But it's a bit cooler.
但这有点凉。 

13
00:00:31,911 --> 00:00:33,619
At the same time, there are fewer states,
同时，状态更少

14
00:00:33,619 --> 00:00:35,369
so I think it's easier to manage.
所以我认为它更容易管理。 

15
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:38,285
How many people know how to play DDR?
有多少人知道怎么玩DDR？ 

16
00:00:38,286 --> 00:00:38,989
AUDIENCE: Well.
听众：嗯。 

17
00:00:39,189 --> 00:00:40,479
PROFESSOR: Yeah.
教授：是的。 

18
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:40,979
OK.
好。 

19
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:43,831
How many people know the rules of playing DDR?
有多少人知道玩DDR的规则？ 

20
00:00:43,832 --> 00:00:46,039
Because otherwise I won't be able to lift my hand up.
因为否则我将无法举起我的手。 

21
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:47,969
OK.
好。 

22
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:51,640
OK, so let's go through an algorithmic model.
好的，让我们看一下算法模型。 

23
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:58,509
So, you have a board that basically looks like this.
因此，您拥有一个基本上像这样的板。 

24
00:00:58,509 --> 00:01:03,089
And you have four touch sensitive pads.
您有四个触摸感应板。 

25
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,140
Up, down, left, right.
上下左右。 

26
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:08,230
And then you have a center position.
然后，您将处于中心位置。 

27
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:13,340
You also have a sheet of notes that looks something like this.
您还会看到一张看起来像这样的笔记。 

28
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:23,700
Say, up, up down, down, up down, up, up down, left right,
说，向上，向上，向下，向下，向上，向下，向上，向上，向下，向左，向右， 

29
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,039
left, left right, right.
左，左，右，右。 

30
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:27,829
So on and so forth.
等等等等。 

31
00:01:27,829 --> 00:01:31,120



32
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,760
So when you see an arrow of up, that's
因此，当您看到向上的箭头时， 

33
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,929
a constraint that says one of your feet
说你一只脚的约束

34
00:01:37,129 --> 00:01:40,310
has to be on the up arrow.
必须在向上箭头上。 

35
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:43,409
Has to tap the up arrow, actually.
实际上必须点击向上箭头。 

36
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:45,469
There's no constraint for the other foot.
另一只脚没有任何约束。 

37
00:01:45,469 --> 00:01:47,769
So your other foot can be anywhere else on the board.
因此，另一只脚可以放在板上的其他任何位置。 

38
00:01:47,769 --> 00:01:49,339
It doesn't matter.
没关系

39
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:52,980
You are also allowed to tap the board some extra times.
您也可以在某些额外时间轻按板子。 

40
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:56,929
So if you don't have a note showing up,
因此，如果您没有出现注释， 

41
00:01:57,129 --> 00:01:58,780
you can still hit the board.
您仍然可以发挥作用。 

42
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,340
And there's no penalty.
而且没有罚款。 

43
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,340
So you can hop around as many times as you want,
这样您就可以随意跳很多次， 

44
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,260
or as many times as you can, until you run out of breath.
或尽可能多的次数，直到您喘不过气来。 

45
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:09,550
So up basically means, it's actually one foot has to be up.
因此，上升基本上意味着必须抬起一只脚。 

46
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:10,900
The other one center.
另一个中心。 

47
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:13,588
Also, of course, because of the design of the board,
而且，当然，由于主板的设计， 

48
00:02:13,588 --> 00:02:15,129
it doesn't matter what foot is where.
哪只脚在哪里都没关系。 

49
00:02:15,129 --> 00:02:18,180



50
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,251
So what are possible goals for this game?
那么这个游戏可能有什么目标呢？ 

51
00:02:22,251 --> 00:02:25,000
AUDIENCE: Not to get an F.
听众：不要拿F。 

52
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,240
PROFESSOR: OK.
教授：好的。 

53
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,711
AUDIENCE: Hit all the arrows when
听众： 

54
00:02:29,711 --> 00:02:32,637
they line up with the top row.
他们与第一行对齐。 

55
00:02:32,637 --> 00:02:33,219
PROFESSOR: OK.
教授：好的。 

56
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:36,680
So there are two different ways of doing it.
因此，有两种不同的实现方法。 

57
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,659
One, you said, "not to get an F."
您说过一个，“不要拿F。” 

58
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:44,020
So I would say, given some limited set of skills.
所以我要说的是，由于技能有限。 

59
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:49,219
So given a set of skills, or your skill level
因此，给定一组技能或您的技能水平

60
00:02:49,219 --> 00:02:50,979
maximizes your score. right?
最大化您的分数。对？ 

61
00:02:50,979 --> 00:02:51,605
AUDIENCE: Yeah.
听众：是的。 

62
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:53,229
PROFESSOR: This is dynamic programming,
教授：这是动态编程， 

63
00:02:53,229 --> 00:02:55,114
so we always want to maximize something.
所以我们一直想最大化某些东西。 

64
00:02:55,115 --> 00:02:58,550



65
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:01,960
Now, if you're really good, then another possible goal
现在，如果您真的很好，那么另一个可能的目标

66
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:10,740
is hit all the notes with a minimum amount of effort.
以最小的努力击中所有音符。 

67
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,495



68
00:03:13,495 --> 00:03:15,120
If you're going to be in a competition,
如果您要参加比赛， 

69
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,703
and you're going to be doing 10 songs,
您将要制作10首歌曲， 

70
00:03:16,703 --> 00:03:19,689
you don't want to die after the first song, right?
你不想死于第一首歌，对吗？ 

71
00:03:19,889 --> 00:03:22,369
So, assuming you can do everything reasonably well,
因此，假设您可以将所有事情做好， 

72
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:25,830
this is another possible goal.
这是另一个可能的目标。 

73
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,804
Any other goals?
还有其他目标吗？ 

74
00:03:28,804 --> 00:03:29,969
So we're brainstorming here.
所以我们在这里集思广益。 

75
00:03:29,969 --> 00:03:32,210
This isn't set in stone.
这不是一成不变的。 

76
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:36,150
We've already seen the formal solution for this problem.
我们已经看到了解决此问题的正式解决方案。 

77
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,430
So I want to play with it for a little bit, right?
所以我想玩一点，对吗？ 

78
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:42,909
We brought a DDR pad, so I want to play with it.
我们带来了DDR垫，所以我想玩它。 

79
00:03:42,909 --> 00:03:45,990
What else could you hope to maximize or minimize
您还希望最大化或最小化什么

80
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,205
for with dynamic programming?
对于动态编程？ 

81
00:03:47,205 --> 00:03:51,262



82
00:03:51,262 --> 00:03:54,590
AUDIENCE: Not look ridiculous.
听众：看起来并不荒谬。 

83
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,469
PROFESSOR: OK.
教授：好的。 

84
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:59,961
AUDIENCE: I guess we're looking at the cost of each move,
观众：我想我们正在考虑的是每一步的成本， 

85
00:03:59,961 --> 00:04:00,460
right?
对？ 

86
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,180
PROFESSOR: So, hit all the notes.
教授：所以，打所有音符。 

87
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:09,685
Minimum effort, or otherwise say best appearance.
花费最少的精力，或者说是最好的外观。 

88
00:04:09,685 --> 00:04:13,530



89
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:18,230
So every move looks somewhat good or somewhat bad.
因此，每一步看起来都有些好坏。 

90
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:21,269
And you want to do the moves that look as good as possible.
您想做的动作看起来尽可能的好。 

91
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:23,410
So this maximizes entertainment, right?
因此，这可以最大程度地提高娱乐性，对吗？ 

92
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:28,439



93
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,829
if you're on TV, you probably want this.
如果您在电视上，则可能需要这样做。 

94
00:04:32,829 --> 00:04:34,589
Now suppose you are in a competition
现在假设您正在参加比赛

95
00:04:34,589 --> 00:04:36,639
and you only have one track to play.
而且只有一首曲目可以播放。 

96
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:41,919



97
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,254
AUDIENCE: Well, you know where all the notes are.
听众：好吧，你知道所有笔记在哪里。 

98
00:04:45,254 --> 00:04:45,920
PROFESSOR: Sure.
教授：当然可以。 

99
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,718
Like, we assume that we know this ahead of time.
就像，我们假设我们提前知道这一点。 

100
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:49,031
So you've memorized this.
所以你已经记住了。 

101
00:04:49,031 --> 00:04:50,990
And you're trying to compute the best strategy,
而且您正在尝试计算最佳策略， 

102
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,031
so you can memorize that.
所以你可以记住。 

103
00:04:52,031 --> 00:04:53,980
Then when you go and play, you dominate.
然后，当您去玩时，您就占了上风。 

104
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,220
AUDIENCE: Yeah.
听众：是的。 

105
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,769
PROFESSOR: So, if you have one track,
教授：所以，如果您有一个曲目， 

106
00:04:56,769 --> 00:04:58,560
then I would say that what you'd want to do
那我想说的是你想做什么

107
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,949
is minimize your probability of failure.
使您的失败可能性降到最低。 

108
00:05:00,949 --> 00:05:01,449
Right?
对？ 

109
00:05:01,449 --> 00:05:05,459
So given the probability of failure for each possible move.
因此，给定每个可能动作失败的可能性。 

110
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:07,750
You want to minimize the overall probability of failure
您希望最大程度地减少失败的可能性

111
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,170
so your teammates won't hate you.
这样你的队友就不会讨厌你。 

112
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:14,386
So, hit all the notes and minimize.
因此，点击所有音符并最小化。 

113
00:05:14,386 --> 00:05:23,836



114
00:05:24,036 --> 00:05:26,370
So this one's a little bit different from the other ones
所以这个跟其他的有点不同

115
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:27,752
because all the other ones are already
因为其他所有的都已经

116
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:30,389
set up as a nice problem where you add up things.
设置为一个很好的问题，在其中添加东西。 

117
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:31,879
So you can solve them with graphs
所以你可以用图来解决

118
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:33,769
or with dynamic programming.
或使用动态编程。 

119
00:05:33,769 --> 00:05:36,579
If you want to minimize the probability of failure,
如果您想最大程度地减少失败的可能性， 

120
00:05:36,579 --> 00:05:39,319
then you want to maximize the probability of success.
那么您想最大化成功的可能性。 

121
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:41,839
The probability of succeeding on all your moves
您的所有举动成功的可能性

122
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:44,549
is the product of the probability
是概率的乘积

123
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,321
of succeeding on each move.
每一步成功的秘诀。 

124
00:05:46,321 --> 00:05:46,620
All right?
好吧？ 

125
00:05:46,819 --> 00:05:48,110
So if you have five moves, then you
因此，如果您有五步动作，那么您

126
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:49,389
have five individual probabilities.
有五个个体概率。 

127
00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:50,539
You multiply them up.
你乘以它们。 

128
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:53,819
And that's the probability that you execute the whole sequence
这就是您执行整个序列的可能性

129
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:55,930
correctly, and not stumble.
正确，而不是绊倒。 

130
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,430
So we have products instead of sums.
所以我们有乘积而不是和。 

131
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:57,759
Yes?
是？ 

132
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,093
AUDIENCE: Isn't it related to the maximizing score goal?
听众：这与最大化得分目标有关吗？ 

133
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:04,379



134
00:06:04,579 --> 00:06:07,240
PROFESSOR: You can.
教授：可以。 

135
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,009
Well, not necessarily because this one
好吧，不一定因为这个

136
00:06:09,209 --> 00:06:12,519
says that you only have some possible moves.
说你只有一些可能的举动。 

137
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:15,449
I think in the end, all of them, except for this last one,
最后，我认为所有这些人，除了最后一个， 

138
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:17,839
can be solved using the recursion depth we have for it.
可以使用我们拥有的递归深度来解决。 

139
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:19,839
The last one, you have to do a bit of massaging.
最后一个，您需要做一些按摩。 

140
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:21,338
And we're going over that right now.
我们现在要解决这个问题。 

141
00:06:21,338 --> 00:06:24,430



142
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:29,610
So, you have products instead of sums.
因此，您需要乘积而不是总和。 

143
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:31,694
How do you turn products into sums?
您如何将产品转化为总和？ 

144
00:06:31,694 --> 00:06:32,909
AUDIENCE: Logs?
听众：原木？ 

145
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:33,850
PROFESSOR: Yep.
教授：是的。 

146
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:38,220
So, for this one, I would want to use logs,
因此，对于这一点，我想使用日志， 

147
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,250
so that I can say that I want to maximize
这样我可以说我想最大化

148
00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:42,199
the log probability of success.
成功的对数概率。 

149
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:45,659
Which is just the sum of the log probabilities for each move.
这只是每一步的对数概率之和。 

150
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:49,379
And then it looks like dynamic programming, as usual.
然后像往常一样看起来像动态编程。 

151
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:51,550
Now, if I wouldn't want to use logs,
现在，如果我不想使用日志， 

152
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:56,920
if I'm using the DP formulation, where I'm doing recursion,
如果我使用DP公式进行递归， 

153
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,790
I can incorporate products there.
我可以在这里合并产品。 

154
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,290
But it turns out, I didn't practice.
事实证明，我没有练习。 

155
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:02,331
If you have a lot of numbers that are close to 1,
如果您有很多接近1的数字

156
00:07:02,331 --> 00:07:05,069
or that are close to 0, so all the easy moves
或接近0，所以所有容易的动作

157
00:07:05,069 --> 00:07:07,920
are going to be really close to 1, for example.
例如，实际上将接近1。 

158
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,310
If you have a lot of numbers that are close to 1 or close
如果您有很多数字接近1或接近

159
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:12,459
to 0, if you multiply them up, you
到0，如果将它们相乘， 

160
00:07:12,459 --> 00:07:13,829
get numerical instabilities.
得到数值不稳定性。 

161
00:07:13,829 --> 00:07:18,000
So we get the number that's really close to 1.
所以我们得到的数字实际上接近于1。 

162
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,100
So for example, if I'm choosing whether to do, say I'm here,
例如，如果我要选择是否要说我在这里， 

163
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:26,230
and I'm thinking, do I want to move like this?
我在想，我想这样走吗？ 

164
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:31,259
Or do I want to move like this, and then like this?
还是我想这样移动然后再这样移动？ 

165
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:32,969
These are both pretty easy moves.
这些都是很容易的举动。 

166
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:35,785
So, in both cases, we're looking at probabilities
因此，在两种情况下，我们都在研究概率

167
00:07:35,785 --> 00:07:38,560
of success of 99.991%.
成功率的99.991％。 

168
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,009
And maybe 99.992%.
也许是99.992％。 

169
00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:44,444
So if you have numbers with probabilities
所以如果你有概率的数字

170
00:07:44,444 --> 00:07:46,819
that are really close to 1, and if you have a lot of them
确实接近1，如果有很多

171
00:07:46,819 --> 00:07:48,959
and you try to multiply them, you're
然后尝试将它们相乘

172
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:50,989
going to get a bad result.
会得到不好的结果。 

173
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:54,439
So all the products are going to start looking the same.
因此，所有产品都将开始看起来相同。 

174
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:56,139
So we're going to get a random solution,
因此，我们将获得一个随机的解决方案， 

175
00:07:56,139 --> 00:07:57,529
instead of what you want.
而不是你想要的。 

176
00:07:57,529 --> 00:07:58,639
This is a practical thing.
这是实际的事情。 

177
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,099
It's called numerical instability.
这就是数值不稳定性。 

178
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,310
And it's a practical reason why you'd
这是您为什么要这样做的实际原因

179
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:06,788
want to use logs, instead of multiplying things up.
想要使用日志，而不是事半功倍。 

180
00:08:06,788 --> 00:08:08,329
So it's not just a theoretical thing.
因此，这不仅仅是理论上的事情。 

181
00:08:08,329 --> 00:08:12,199
It also makes life nice in practice.
在实践中，这也使生活变得美好。 

182
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:12,699
OK.
好。 

183
00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:15,269
So we have a goal that looks like this.
因此，我们的目标看起来像这样。 

184
00:08:15,269 --> 00:08:16,629
Say, let's go for this one.
说，让我们开始吧。 

185
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:18,819
Hit all the notes, minimize the effort.
打所有的笔记，最大程度地减少工作量。 

186
00:08:18,819 --> 00:08:23,480
And all the other ones can be reduced to this one.
所有其他的都可以简化为这个。 

187
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,490
We need to define effort, right?
我们需要定义努力，对吗？ 

188
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:29,300
Let's say that we have a function called delta, that
假设我们有一个叫做delta的函数

189
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,279
takes two foot locations-- so, where both of my feet
需要两个脚的位置-所以，我的两只脚

190
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:38,500
are-- from and to.
是-从和到。 

191
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:48,470
And it gives me a number from 0 to 1, where 0 is really easy.
它给了我一个从0到1的数字，其中0真的很简单。 

192
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:49,980
And 1 is really hard.
而且1真的很难。 

193
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:54,190



194
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:58,480
So from would look something like, my left foot is up.
因此，从看起来像，我的左脚向上。 

195
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,230
My right foot is centered.
我的右脚居中。 

196
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:04,230
To would look something like, my left foot is centered
看起来像是我的左脚居中

197
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,349
and my right foot is up.
我的右脚抬起

198
00:09:05,549 --> 00:09:10,729
So basically going from here to here.
所以基本上是从这里到这里。 

199
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:12,427
So from left foot up.
所以从左脚向上。 

200
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:13,330
Right foot center.
右脚中心。 

201
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:13,960
To here.
到这里。 

202
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,432



203
00:09:16,432 --> 00:09:18,139
So there is some difficulty there, right?
所以那里有些困难，对吧？ 

204
00:09:18,139 --> 00:09:19,830
We have to jump, so it's not 0.
我们必须跳，所以它不是0。 

205
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:23,230
I'm burning some calories here.
我在这里燃烧一些卡路里。 

206
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,529
So any move that I make has some difficulty.
因此，我的任何举动都会有些困难。 

207
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:28,299
And I want to solve the game so that overall I
我想解决游戏问题，以便总的来说， 

208
00:09:28,299 --> 00:09:32,449
have a reasonably small total difficulty.
总难度相对较小。 

209
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:37,089



210
00:09:37,289 --> 00:09:41,129
OK, are we understanding the problem?
好，我们了解问题了吗？ 

211
00:09:41,129 --> 00:09:43,610
So we have three possible avenues here.
因此，这里有三个可能的途径。 

212
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:47,039
We can start solving it using dynamic programming.
我们可以开始使用动态编程来解决它。 

213
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:49,549
We can start solving it using graphs.
我们可以开始使用图形来解决它。 

214
00:09:49,549 --> 00:09:52,669
Or we can have someone else play the DDR again so that we
或者我们可以让其他人再次玩DDR，以便我们

215
00:09:52,669 --> 00:09:54,120
can get more hands on experience,
可以获得更多经验

216
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,860
and look at what a good strategy or a bad strategy looks like.
然后看一下好策略或坏策略的模样。 

217
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:58,860
So you guys get to vote.
这样你们就可以投票了。 

218
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,789
Who wants to solve this using the dynamic programming?
谁想使用动态编程解决这个问题？ 

219
00:10:01,789 --> 00:10:04,490



220
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:08,549
Who wants to solve this using graphs?
谁想用图表解决这个问题？ 

221
00:10:08,549 --> 00:10:10,379
Who wants to get more hands on experience?
谁想获得更多实践经验？ 

222
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:13,019



223
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:15,159
Damn.
该死的。 

224
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:17,279
I was hoping that DDR would win.
我希望DDR能赢。 

225
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,620
You guys are boring.
你们真无聊

226
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,831
So, graphs, right?
那么，图吧？ 

227
00:10:20,831 --> 00:10:21,914
We're going to have notes.
我们将有笔记。 

228
00:10:21,914 --> 00:10:26,360



229
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,820
Notes represent states, right?
注释代表状态，对不对？ 

230
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:31,099
So a state is where you are at some point in the game.
因此，状态是您在游戏中处于某个位置的位置。 

231
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:34,509
And we'll have to define what where you are means.
而且，我们必须定义您所在的位置。 

232
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:37,549
And then, when you jump, you make a move.
然后，当您跳跃时，便采取了行动。 

233
00:10:37,549 --> 00:10:40,149
So moves go between states.
因此，在状态之间进行移动。 

234
00:10:40,149 --> 00:10:42,370
So in any game, you have states and moves.
因此，在任何游戏中，您都有状态和动作。 

235
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:43,980
A state is very hard to put in time.
状态很难及时设定。 

236
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:44,820
And then you make a move.
然后您采取行动。 

237
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:45,620
Like in chess.
就像在国际象棋中一样。 

238
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,269
Your state is your board position.
您的状态就是您的董事会职位。 

239
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:49,199
And whether you're moving, or your opponent
不管你是移动还是对手

240
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,865
is the next to move.
是下一步行动。 

241
00:10:50,865 --> 00:10:53,490
And the move is when you take a piece and put it from one place
而移动就是当您从一块放到一块放到一块

242
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:53,989
to another.
到另一个。 

243
00:10:53,989 --> 00:10:57,959



244
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:59,709
So your vertices are states.
因此，您的顶点就是状态。 

245
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:03,269
And your edges are moves.
和你的边缘是移动。 

246
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:05,899



247
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:10,110
So what's in a state?
那么状态如何？ 

248
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,849
This is our problem.
这是我们的问题。 

249
00:11:12,049 --> 00:11:13,740
Whether we're solving it with graphs
是否用图来解决

250
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,139
or with dynamic programming, this
或通过动态编程， 

251
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:17,937
is what everything comes down to.
就是一切。 

252
00:11:17,937 --> 00:11:18,769
What's in the state?
状态如何？ 

253
00:11:18,769 --> 00:11:29,189



254
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:31,440
AUDIENCE: So your current state is how much difficulty
观众：所以您目前的状态是多少困难

255
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,719
have you-- what is the problem?
你有什么问题吗？ 

256
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:36,671
Are those representing the probabilities,
是代表概率的那些， 

257
00:11:36,672 --> 00:11:37,379
the difficulties?
困难？ 

258
00:11:37,379 --> 00:11:38,399
Or.
要么。 

259
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,459
PROFESSOR: So this is the difficulty for one move.
教授：这就是一举一动的困难。 

260
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:44,000
Does it depend on previous moves?
是否取决于先前的举动？ 

261
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,797
AUDIENCE: No, but.
听众：不，但是。 

262
00:11:44,797 --> 00:11:45,379
PROFESSOR: No.
教授：不。 

263
00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:47,529
So it's a nice thing to note that the difficulties
因此，很高兴注意到困难

264
00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:48,778
for each move are independent.
每个动作都是独立的。 

265
00:11:48,778 --> 00:11:58,745



266
00:11:58,745 --> 00:12:01,216
AUDIENCE: Would it be dependent in real life?
听众：这会取决于现实生活吗？ 

267
00:12:01,216 --> 00:12:02,697
You'll get tired at the end.
最后你会累的。 

268
00:12:02,697 --> 00:12:05,168
And he's able to have less energy.
而且他的能量更少。 

269
00:12:05,168 --> 00:12:07,544



270
00:12:07,544 --> 00:12:08,169
PROFESSOR: Yep.
教授：是的。 

271
00:12:08,169 --> 00:12:12,059
So, in real life, we might want to say that this actually
因此，在现实生活中，我们可能想说

272
00:12:12,059 --> 00:12:15,869
depends on how much energy you've expended so far.
取决于您到目前为止已消耗了多少能量。 

273
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:18,740
And if we have time, let's solve that problem.
如果有时间，让我们解决这个问题。 

274
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:24,979



275
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:26,679
So the nice thing about this problem
所以关于这个问题的好处

276
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:29,949
is there are many directions in which we can take it.
我们可以采取许多方向吗？ 

277
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:30,719
This is one of them.
这就是其中之一。 

278
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm fine.
我很好。 

279
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,779
And I think we'll learn a lot by doing that.
我认为这样做会学到很多东西。 

280
00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:37,339
So back to the original problem.
回到原来的问题。 

281
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:40,100
Suppose that it doesn't matter how tired you are.
假设你有多累都没关系。 

282
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,720
You're pretty good, so you're not
你很好，所以你不是

283
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,413
going to be tired enough to go [GASP].
够累了[GASP]。 

284
00:12:43,413 --> 00:12:46,519



285
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:50,019
So, mostly independent difficulties for each move.
因此，每个动作大多都是独立的困难。 

286
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:53,240
What's in a state?
什么状态？ 

287
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,417
AUDIENCE: The sum of the difficulties up to that point.
听众：到那时为止困难的总和。 

288
00:12:56,417 --> 00:12:57,000
PROFESSOR: OK.
教授：好的。 

289
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,500
So.
所以。 

290
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:09,666



291
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:11,564
AUDIENCE: Your appearance factor,
听众：你的外表因素， 

292
00:13:11,764 --> 00:13:12,884
if we're including that.
如果我们包括在内。 

293
00:13:12,884 --> 00:13:13,610
Or are we only doing--
还是我们只是在做- 

294
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:14,700
PROFESSOR: So we're doing this.
教授：所以我们正在这样做。 

295
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,759



296
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:17,801
AUDIENCE: Oh, I was just.
听众：哦，我只是。 

297
00:13:17,801 --> 00:13:18,763
Oh, effort.
辛苦了

298
00:13:18,763 --> 00:13:19,729
OK, we're minimizing effort.
好的，我们正在努力。 

299
00:13:19,929 --> 00:13:21,803
PROFESSOR: So the way I like to think of this
教授：所以我喜欢这样想

300
00:13:21,803 --> 00:13:23,589
is, what is does a solution look like?
是，解决方案是什么样的？ 

301
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:25,257
It's made up of decisions, right?
它是由决定组成的，对不对？ 

302
00:13:25,457 --> 00:13:26,415
What are the decisions?
有什么决定？ 

303
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:29,090



304
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:33,500
AUDIENCE: To make that move or don't make that move?
听众：要采取行动还是不采取行动？ 

305
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,470
PROFESSOR: We'll see.
教授：我们会看到的。 

306
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:35,839
But once you know what the decisions are,
但是一旦知道了决定是什么， 

307
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:38,456
then you have to think, what do I need to make a decision?
然后您必须考虑，我需要做出什么决定？ 

308
00:13:38,456 --> 00:13:41,479



309
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:43,649
AUDIENCE: The note.
听众：笔记。 

310
00:13:43,649 --> 00:13:51,840
PROFESSOR: So, a note is one of these.
教授：因此，便笺就是其中之一。 

311
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,000
For some reason, they're called notes.
由于某种原因，它们被称为便笺。 

312
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,716



313
00:13:58,716 --> 00:14:00,299
AUDIENCE: So you know that somehow you
听众：所以你以某种方式知道你

314
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:01,949
have to hit all of them?
必须打所有人？ 

315
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:04,915
Like, you can have steps in between.
就像，您可以在两者之间进行操作。 

316
00:14:05,115 --> 00:14:05,740
PROFESSOR: Yep.
教授：是的。 

317
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:06,864
AUDIENCE: Moves in between.
听众：在两者之间移动。 

318
00:14:06,864 --> 00:14:08,480
You have to hit all of them.
您必须全部击中。 

319
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,219
PROFESSOR: OK, so I like this.
教授：好的，所以我喜欢这个。 

320
00:14:10,419 --> 00:14:15,639
So, every one of these is going to have to generate a move.
因此，其中的每一个都将不得不采取行动。 

321
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:17,429
And there might be some moves in between.
两者之间可能会有一些动作。 

322
00:14:17,429 --> 00:14:24,649



323
00:14:24,649 --> 00:14:26,949
Well, each move is going to map to some edge.
好吧，每一步都将映射到某个边缘。 

324
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,959
And I'm going to need vertices.
而且我将需要顶点。 

325
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:33,509
So, as an algorithms program where when I hear that, oh.
所以，作为算法程序，当我听到时，哦。 

326
00:14:33,509 --> 00:14:36,039
I can have some moves in between, I get really uneasy.
我之间可以有一些动作，我真的很不安。 

327
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:37,423
Like, what is this?
就像，这是什么？ 

328
00:14:37,423 --> 00:14:38,840
How many moves am I going to have?
我要走几步？ 

329
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,340
Is this going to become really huge?
这会变得非常巨大吗？ 

330
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:43,950
And am I not going to be able to run any algorithm on it?
而且我将无法在其上运行任何算法吗？ 

331
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,200
So let's think about that.
因此，让我们考虑一下。 

332
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,709
How many moves would I have in between?
我之间会有几步动作？ 

333
00:14:46,909 --> 00:14:48,408
And, what would I achieve with them?
而且，我将与他们达成什么目标？ 

334
00:14:48,408 --> 00:14:52,519



335
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:55,759
AUDIENCE: I guess you'd have a max of, like, four, right?
听众：我想您最多可以有四个，对吧？ 

336
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:58,583
I mean, you can put your right leg someplace,
我的意思是，您可以将右腿放在某个位置， 

337
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:00,250
and you can put your left leg someplace.
你可以把你的左腿放在某个地方。 

338
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,870
That's like a max of two.
最多只能有两个。 

339
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:03,370
Right?
对？ 

340
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:04,350
Or no?
或者没有？ 

341
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:07,350
PROFESSOR: So, let's think of an example.
教授：那么，让我们考虑一个例子。 

342
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:10,469
You want to go, say, I want to go, what?
你想去，说，我想去，什么？ 

343
00:15:10,669 --> 00:15:12,929
From here to here, right?
从这里到这里，对吗？ 

344
00:15:12,929 --> 00:15:13,979
AUDIENCE: Um-hmm.
听众：嗯。 

345
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,110
PROFESSOR: And you're thinking what?
教授：那你在想什么？ 

346
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:19,750
They can do this, oh sorry.
他们可以这样做，抱歉。 

347
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,429
So I can do this as one move.
因此，我可以一口气做到这一点。 

348
00:15:21,429 --> 00:15:22,419
And this is one move.
这是一招。 

349
00:15:22,419 --> 00:15:22,548
AUDIENCE: Yeah.
听众：是的。 

350
00:15:22,548 --> 00:15:24,235
Or you can just do one jump, right?
或者您也可以跳一跳，对吗？ 

351
00:15:24,235 --> 00:15:25,644
So it's-- oh, yeah.
哦，是的。 

352
00:15:25,644 --> 00:15:27,569
I guess that's more than one.
我想那不止一个。 

353
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:29,090
PROFESSOR: OK.
教授：好的。 

354
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:31,459
So looking at this, if I'm considering
所以看这个，如果我正在考虑

355
00:15:31,659 --> 00:15:35,240
whether to go from here to here.
是否从这里到这里。 

356
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:41,186
If I want to go either this way, or if I want to go this way.
如果我想这样走，或者我想这样走。 

357
00:15:41,386 --> 00:15:42,969
So let's write this down on the board.
因此，让我们将其写下来。 

358
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:46,149



359
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:54,049
So I'm going from up down to left right.
所以我要从上到下从左到右。 

360
00:15:54,049 --> 00:15:56,120
And I'm considering, do I want to go directly
我正在考虑，我想直接去吗

361
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:01,690
or do I want to go up right first.
还是我想先上升。 

362
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:04,980
And then left right.
然后从左向右。 

363
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,980
Let's not do these arrows because they're confusing.
我们不要做这些箭头，因为它们很混乱。 

364
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,859
So, do I want to transition like this?
那么，我要这样过渡吗？ 

365
00:16:10,059 --> 00:16:12,989
Or do I want to transition like this?
还是我想这样过渡？ 

366
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:19,700
Well, I claim that, since my moves are independent,
好吧，我声称，由于我的举动是独立的， 

367
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:23,990
going from here to here, if it's beneficial to go
从这里到这里，如果有益的话

368
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:25,990
this way instead of this way, I would
这样，而不是这样，我会

369
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:28,070
want to go this way all the time.
想一直走这种路。 

370
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,330
So I would just say that, look.
所以，我只想说，看。 

371
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:32,171
Inside my delta here, I would say that, actually,
在我的三角洲内，我会说，实际上， 

372
00:16:32,371 --> 00:16:34,370
if you know what you're doing, whenever you have
如果知道自己在做什么，只要有

373
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:36,779
to go from here to here, you're going to go like this.
从这里到这里，您将像这样去。 

374
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:39,649
And the delta is going to report to the total delta for this.
增量将为此报告总增量。 

375
00:16:39,649 --> 00:16:43,699



376
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:48,949
So, if the problem is that they have one note,
因此，如果问题在于他们只有一张纸条， 

377
00:16:49,149 --> 00:16:52,549
and then I have my next note like this, between these two
然后我在这两个之间有下一个音符

378
00:16:52,549 --> 00:16:55,609
notes, I can always go in one move.
笔记，我总是可以一move而就。 

379
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:58,543



380
00:16:58,543 --> 00:16:59,960
AUDIENCE: So you're saying 1 would
听众：所以你说1 

381
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,349
like, including in our difficulty function,
包括我们的难度函数在内

382
00:17:03,549 --> 00:17:06,149
it'll also tell us, like, what move
它也会告诉我们，例如什么动作

383
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,900
we should make to get there?
我们应该去那里吗？ 

384
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,099
PROFESSOR: How to get there.
教授：如何到达那里。 

385
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:11,269
The best way to get from one state to another.
从一种状态到达另一种状态的最佳方法。 

386
00:17:11,269 --> 00:17:12,769
Well, like when you're learning DDR,
好吧，就像您在学习DDR一样， 

387
00:17:12,769 --> 00:17:14,990
these are the basic steps, right?
这些是基本步骤，对吧？ 

388
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:17,680
Like, you practice until you know how to get from one place
就像，你练习直到知道如何从一个地方去

389
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,410
to another.
到另一个。 

390
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:21,960
There is something else where you need intermediate steps.
还有其他一些地方需要中间步骤。 

391
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:26,218



392
00:17:26,218 --> 00:17:27,634
AUDIENCE: Or if you're holding one
听众：或者如果您拿着一个

393
00:17:27,634 --> 00:17:30,684
and then you've got to move to another.
然后您必须移至另一个。 

394
00:17:30,684 --> 00:17:31,184
Right?
对？ 

395
00:17:31,184 --> 00:17:35,019



396
00:17:35,019 --> 00:17:36,809
PROFESSOR: So, let's not worry about holds.
教授：所以，我们不用担心搁置。 

397
00:17:36,809 --> 00:17:38,393
Let's say that we would just represent
假设我们只是代表

398
00:17:38,393 --> 00:17:43,390
holds as-- so if you have a hold in a game, then
保持为-因此，如果您在游戏中处于保持状态，则

399
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:45,169
we're just going to represent it like this.
我们只是要这样表示。 

400
00:17:45,369 --> 00:17:46,243
We're going to cheat.
我们要作弊。 

401
00:17:46,243 --> 00:17:49,289



402
00:17:49,289 --> 00:17:50,945
So we don't have to deal with it.
因此，我们不必处理它。 

403
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:52,819
In real life, you would have to deal with it.
在现实生活中，您将不得不处理它。 

404
00:17:52,819 --> 00:17:55,360
Like if you're actually writing a program that trains people.
就像您实际上在编写训练人员的程序一样。 

405
00:17:55,361 --> 00:17:59,970
AUDIENCE: What happens if you have, like, right, left, up
听众：如果您有左右，左上，左上的姿势会怎样

406
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:00,779
or something.
或者其他的东西。 

407
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:04,200
So let's say you start off hitting your right foot
假设您开始打右脚

408
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:10,836
on the top, and then you have to hit the right one again.
在顶部，然后您必须再次点击正确的一个。 

409
00:18:10,836 --> 00:18:12,420
And then you have to hit up again
然后你必须再打一次

410
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,670
and then you have to transfer.
然后您必须转移。 

411
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:17,700
So I guess anytime you have to through the middle.
所以我想您随时都需要经历中间阶段。 

412
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,700
You have move your foot.
你已经动了脚。 

413
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:23,539
PROFESSOR: So I like the idea of going through the middle.
教授：所以我喜欢经历中间的想法。 

414
00:18:23,539 --> 00:18:27,953
Why or how do you, why would you go through the middle?
你为什么或怎么样，为什么要经历中间？ 

415
00:18:27,953 --> 00:18:32,098
AUDIENCE: To avoid crossing your leg over or something.
听众：为避免双腿交叉或其他东西。 

416
00:18:32,098 --> 00:18:34,264
PROFESSOR: Well, what if I have something like this?
教授：好吧，如果我有这样的事情怎么办？ 

417
00:18:34,265 --> 00:18:37,590



418
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:40,539
If there are DDR experts, I know this isn't the right way
如果有DDR专家，我知道这不是正确的方法

419
00:18:40,539 --> 00:18:41,039
to do it.
去做吧。 

420
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:49,595
But one way of doing it is left, right, left, right, left,
但是一种方法是左，右，左，右，左， 

421
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:51,640
right.
对。 

422
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,950
So then, I have some states that account for the fact
因此，我有一些状态说明了这一事实

423
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:54,740
that I'm centering.
我正在居中。 

424
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:57,420



425
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,879
So, some people like to do this, right?
所以，有些人喜欢这样做，对吗？ 

426
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:02,069
Some people like to go to the center as much as possible,
有些人喜欢尽可能地去中心， 

427
00:19:02,069 --> 00:19:04,500
if they have time between the moves.
如果他们在两次行动之间有时间。 

428
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,059
So then, I would need at least one state
因此，我将需要至少一个状态

429
00:19:07,059 --> 00:19:11,166
in between where I'm allowed to center, right?
在允许我居中的位置之间，对吗？ 

430
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:13,000
In order to represent what I just did there,
为了代表我刚才在那做的事， 

431
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,569
I need one move.
我需要一招。 

432
00:19:14,569 --> 00:19:21,490



433
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:24,609
So, one way I could meet this is I have left center.
因此，我可以实现的一种方法是离开中心。 

434
00:19:24,609 --> 00:19:26,979
And then left right.
然后从左向右。 

435
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:30,729
And then left right, left right, left right.
然后左右，左右，左右。 

436
00:19:30,729 --> 00:19:31,519
So on and so forth.
等等等等。 

437
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:35,160
But this would mean that instead of doing this, which
但这意味着，而不是这样做， 

438
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,890
is reasonably easy, I would have to do this.
是相当容易的，我必须这样做。 

439
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:38,589
This.
这个。 

440
00:19:38,589 --> 00:19:40,939
And then jump, jump, jump, jump every time.
然后每次跳，跳，跳，跳。 

441
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:41,900
Harder.
更难。 

442
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:42,930
Not good.
不好。 

443
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:43,669
Not good for my knees.
对我的膝盖不好。 

444
00:19:43,869 --> 00:19:45,195
Not good for my score.
对我的分数不好。 

445
00:19:45,195 --> 00:19:46,319
So I don't want to do this.
所以我不想这样做。 

446
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:50,200
I want to have an intermediate state so I can say,
我想要一个中间状态，所以我可以说， 

447
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,139
I start here and then I get back here.
我从这里开始，然后回到这里。 

448
00:19:53,339 --> 00:19:55,539
Then I do this.
那我做

449
00:19:55,539 --> 00:19:56,609
Then I get back here.
然后我回到这里。 

450
00:19:56,609 --> 00:19:59,689
Then I go here.
那我去这里

451
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:02,630
And then I go back here.
然后我回到这里。 

452
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:03,309
And then go back.
然后回去。 

453
00:20:03,509 --> 00:20:06,131
Do guys see how this works?
大家知道这是怎么回事吗？ 

454
00:20:06,131 --> 00:20:07,763
AUDIENCE: You could also rock back and forth
听众：您也可以来回摇摆

455
00:20:07,963 --> 00:20:10,881
to because they don't require both feet to be on the ground
因为他们不需要两只脚都在地上

456
00:20:10,882 --> 00:20:12,269
the entire time.
整个时间。 

457
00:20:12,269 --> 00:20:13,559
PROFESSOR: Rock back and forth.
教授：来回摇摆。 

458
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:14,308
Hold that thought.
保持那个想法。 

459
00:20:14,308 --> 00:20:17,168



460
00:20:17,169 --> 00:20:18,210
That might come in handy.
可能会派上用场。 

461
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:20,269
Assuming we have enough time.
假设我们有足够的时间。 

462
00:20:20,269 --> 00:20:23,549
So, if we only do one move every time we see a note,
因此，如果我们每次看到音符时只走一动， 

463
00:20:23,549 --> 00:20:25,720
we're stuck with this.
我们被困住了。 

464
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,180
In our to allow re-centering, we have
为了使我们能够重新居中，我们有

465
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:32,549
to add states between the notes.
在注释之间添加状态。 

466
00:20:32,549 --> 00:20:35,210
We need to add an intermediary state.
我们需要添加一个中间状态。 

467
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:39,529
And you can either think about it, or take my word for it,
您可以考虑一下，也可以相信我， 

468
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:43,569
but if you represent the notes using the trick that I said
但是如果您使用我说的技巧来代表笔记

469
00:20:43,569 --> 00:20:47,460
above, and you want to represent centering, then all you need
以上，而您想代表居中，那么您所需要的就是

470
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,069
is one extra state.
是一种额外的状态。 

471
00:20:49,069 --> 00:20:50,960
So one extra move between every two states.
因此，每两个状态之间要多移动一个。 

472
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:56,139



473
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:57,209
Between two notes.
在两个音符之间。 

474
00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:00,319



475
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:01,069
And that's enough.
这就足够了。 

476
00:21:01,069 --> 00:21:03,269
Because that one extra state allows you to center.
因为那一种额外的状态使您能够居中。 

477
00:21:03,269 --> 00:21:06,609
And it allows you to do pretty much everything a beginner
它使您几乎可以做初学者的所有事情

478
00:21:06,609 --> 00:21:10,169
like me would know how to do.
像我一样会怎么做。 

479
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:13,875
AUDIENCE: So you only need one extra state between each note?
听众：那么您在每个音符之间只需要一个额外的状态？ 

480
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:14,500
PROFESSOR: Yep.
教授：是的。 

481
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,690
That is the inside.
那就是里面。 

482
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:18,639
That is where I'm thinking, right?
那是我在想的地方，对吧？ 

483
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:22,490
So I have to do both this trick, to see
所以我必须同时做这把戏

484
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:25,299
that I don't need an infinite number of steps.
我不需要无数个步骤。 

485
00:21:25,299 --> 00:21:28,319
And come up with the need for centering
并提出居中的需求

486
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:30,290
to see why I need one intermediate step.
了解为什么我需要一个中间步骤。 

487
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:33,491



488
00:21:33,491 --> 00:21:34,950
By the way, does anyone know what's
顺便说一句，有人知道什么吗

489
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:36,594
the right way of doing that?
正确的做法吗？ 

490
00:21:36,594 --> 00:21:38,259
What's the right way of doing this move?
采取此举的正确方法是什么？ 

491
00:21:38,259 --> 00:21:41,509



492
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:42,779
You said, rock back and forth.
你说，来回晃动。 

493
00:21:42,779 --> 00:21:44,859
So I wouldn't rock back and forth in this case, right?
因此，在这种情况下，我不会来回摇摆，对吗？ 

494
00:21:44,859 --> 00:21:45,939
Because that wouldn't be helpful.
因为那不会有帮助。 

495
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:46,447
How would I rock?
我会如何摇滚？ 

496
00:21:46,647 --> 00:21:48,155
AUDIENCE: Well, you hold down one
听众：嗯，你按住一个

497
00:21:48,155 --> 00:21:49,529
and then you go to the other one.
然后您转到另一个。 

498
00:21:49,529 --> 00:21:51,730
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so rock left and right.
教授：是的，所以左右摇摆。 

499
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:52,337
OK.
好。 

500
00:21:52,337 --> 00:21:54,529
AUDIENCE: I said back and forth, I meant rocking--
听众：我来回说，我的意思是摇摆- 

501
00:21:54,529 --> 00:21:55,238
PROFESSOR: Sorry.
教授：对不起。 

502
00:21:55,238 --> 00:21:57,170
I thought back, forth.
我回想了一下。 

503
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:58,889
So, the optimal way of doing this
所以，这样做的最佳方法

504
00:21:59,089 --> 00:22:04,689
is left, right, left, right, left, right.
是左，右，左，右，左，右。 

505
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,497
So what am I doing?
那我在做什么呢？ 

506
00:22:06,497 --> 00:22:07,629
AUDIENCE: You have another move.
听众：您还有另外一个举动。 

507
00:22:07,829 --> 00:22:11,280



508
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,460
You have, like, one state for your foot where
您的脚有一种状态

509
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,400
it's not touching the ground.
它没有触地。 

510
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:17,909
PROFESSOR: OK.
教授：好的。 

511
00:22:18,109 --> 00:22:20,159
It's an interesting, and important, distinction.
这是一个有趣且重要的区别。 

512
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,160
So if I wanted to hit both of them, if I'm here,
所以如果我想打他们两个，如果我在这里， 

513
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,200
and I need to hit both of them, I need to hit them.
我需要打他们两个，我需要打他们。 

514
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,769
If I only need to hit one of them, if I'm here,
如果我只需要打一个，如果我在这里， 

515
00:22:27,769 --> 00:22:29,430
I can hit it like this.
我可以这样打

516
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:31,180
If I'm here, though, and I want to hit it,
如果我在这里，但我想打它， 

517
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:34,659
I have to lift myself up.
我必须振作起来。 

518
00:22:34,659 --> 00:22:36,450
So the difference is whether I'm like this.
所以区别在于我是否喜欢这个。 

519
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:37,409
Or like this.
或者像这样。 

520
00:22:37,409 --> 00:22:38,200
Where is my weight?
我的体重在哪里？ 

521
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:42,690



522
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:44,659
So if I want to allow for these moves,
因此，如果我想允许这些举动， 

523
00:22:44,859 --> 00:22:47,799
if I want to go past the stage of very beginner,
如果我想超越初学者的阶段， 

524
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:50,190
aside from keeping track of where my feet are,
除了跟踪我的脚在哪里， 

525
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:52,750
I have to keep track of whether my weight is on my left foot
我必须跟踪自己的体重是否在左脚上

526
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,920
or on my right foot.
或在我的右脚。 

527
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:58,369
So, I would actually have l, r, and W,
因此，我实际上会有l，r和W， 

528
00:22:58,569 --> 00:23:01,210
where W is either l or r.
其中W是l或r。 

529
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:06,937



530
00:23:07,137 --> 00:23:11,264
AUDIENCE: So your state now has what you're currently
听众：所以您的州现在拥有您目前的状态

531
00:23:11,265 --> 00:23:13,609
putting more weight on.
加大重量。 

532
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,769
PROFESSOR: And where each of the feet are.
教授：每只脚都在哪里。 

533
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:16,660
AUDIENCE: Yeah.
听众：是的。 

534
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,890
Where your two feet are.
你的两只脚在哪里。 

535
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:21,945
And then also, the song difficulty.
然后还有歌曲的难度

536
00:23:22,145 --> 00:23:24,069
So it's everything in your state, right?
一切都在您的状态中，对吧？ 

537
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,470
PROFESSOR: Ah, yes.
教授：是的。 

538
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:26,470
I didn't think about it.
我没有考虑。 

539
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:28,159
I was just talking about foot position.
我只是在谈论脚的位置。 

540
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:29,950
But we need to get back to the state thing.
但是我们需要回到状态。 

541
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,269
So that's a good point.
这是一个好点。 

542
00:23:31,269 --> 00:23:35,359
So before we get to that, how many feet positions do we have?
那么在我们做到这一点之前，我们要先坐几英尺？ 

543
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:39,609
If we don't include where do I have my weight,
如果我们不包括我的体重， 

544
00:23:39,609 --> 00:23:42,229
how many possible positions for both of my feet do I have?
我的双脚有几个可能的位置？ 

545
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:47,349



546
00:23:47,349 --> 00:23:48,369
So I have two feet.
所以我有两只脚。 

547
00:23:48,369 --> 00:23:51,909
Each of them can be in any of these five squares, right?
每个人都可以在这五个正方形中的任何一个中，对吗？ 

548
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:53,842
So how many total positions?
那么总职位数是多少？ 

549
00:23:54,042 --> 00:23:57,255
AUDIENCE: 5 choose 2.
受众群体：5选择2。 

550
00:23:57,256 --> 00:23:58,419
Using 2.
使用2。 

551
00:23:58,619 --> 00:24:00,357
PROFESSOR: So I can do this.
教授：所以我可以这样做。 

552
00:24:00,357 --> 00:24:00,982
AUDIENCE: Sure.
听众：好的。 

553
00:24:00,982 --> 00:24:02,339
Why not?
为什么不？ 

554
00:24:02,339 --> 00:24:04,615
PROFESSOR: Well, if I have 5 choose 2, then you--
教授：好吧，如果我有5个选择2，那么您- 

555
00:24:04,615 --> 00:24:05,430
AUDIENCE: Oh, then that doesn't quite work.
听众：哦，那还行不通。 

556
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:06,096
PROFESSOR: Yeah.
教授：是的。 

557
00:24:06,096 --> 00:24:07,819
AUDIENCE: Yeah, no.
听众：是的，不。 

558
00:24:07,819 --> 00:24:12,977
PROFESSOR: So flip.
教授：那么翻转。 

559
00:24:12,978 --> 00:24:13,533
AUDIENCE: Times 2.
观众：次2。 

560
00:24:13,733 --> 00:24:14,399
PROFESSOR: Yeah.
教授：是的。 

561
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,980
So you have two feet.
所以你有两只脚。 

562
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,259
Each foot, five possibilities.
每只脚有五种可能性。 

563
00:24:17,259 --> 00:24:21,519



564
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:23,109
Now, what if we have weight?
现在，如果我们有体重怎么办？ 

565
00:24:23,109 --> 00:24:25,669
If we are tracking on where I keep my weight.
如果我们要跟踪我在哪里保持体重。 

566
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:27,275
How many possible positions?
有多少个职位？ 

567
00:24:27,275 --> 00:24:31,006



568
00:24:31,006 --> 00:24:31,970
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?
听众：[听不清]？ 

569
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,480
Oh no, because there's only two.
哦，不，因为只有两个。 

570
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,700
PROFESSOR: So, for each of these,
教授：因此，对于每个

571
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,470
there's two possibilities now.
现在有两种可能性。 

572
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:39,169
So 50.
 50。 

573
00:24:39,369 --> 00:24:41,169
AUDIENCE: You also have to be so your weight is like this.
听众：您也必须如此，这样才能保持体重。 

574
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:41,880
PROFESSOR: In the middle?
教授：在中间吗？ 

575
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,619
AUDIENCE: Yeah.
听众：是的。 

576
00:24:42,819 --> 00:24:44,287
PROFESSOR: You can.
教授：可以。 

577
00:24:44,287 --> 00:24:46,419
Based on that what I've been reading, you never want to.
基于我一直在阅读的内容，您永远不会想要。 

578
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:48,369
Because if you're weight is in the middle,
因为如果您的体重在中间， 

579
00:24:48,369 --> 00:24:53,228
then you're extending a lot of effort to move either foot.
那么您将花费很多精力来移动任一只脚。 

580
00:24:53,229 --> 00:24:55,269
So you always want to have your weight somewhere.
因此，您始终希望将体重放在某个地方。 

581
00:24:55,269 --> 00:24:56,894
So that, at least for one of your feet,
因此，至少对于您的一只脚， 

582
00:24:56,894 --> 00:24:58,848
it's easy to move it.
移动起来很容易。 

583
00:24:58,848 --> 00:25:00,581
AUDIENCE: Could it be the back?
听众：会回来吗？ 

584
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:02,089
PROFESSOR: If that's not true, then yeah.
教授：如果不是这样，那么是的。 

585
00:25:02,289 --> 00:25:04,568
We'd need to have a center.
我们需要一个中心。 

586
00:25:04,568 --> 00:25:06,609
Oh, so, like, whether I'm like this or like this?
哦，所以，就像我是这样还是这样？ 

587
00:25:06,609 --> 00:25:06,851
AUDIENCE: Yeah.
听众：是的。 

588
00:25:06,852 --> 00:25:08,554
If you were, like, doing the same thing.
如果您喜欢做同样的事情。 

589
00:25:08,554 --> 00:25:09,329
Rocking back and forth.
来回摇摆。 

590
00:25:09,529 --> 00:25:10,945
PROFESSOR: So, if I have two feet,
教授：如果我有两只脚， 

591
00:25:10,945 --> 00:25:13,099
then this says my weight is on my left foot.
这说明我的体重在我的左脚上。 

592
00:25:13,099 --> 00:25:15,069
My weight is on my right foot.
我的体重在我的右脚上。 

593
00:25:15,069 --> 00:25:20,069
So l and r is which foot, not where on the board.
所以l和r是哪只脚，而不是木板上的位置。 

594
00:25:20,069 --> 00:25:22,899
AUDIENCE: So, did you not do center because it was optimal?
听众：那么，您不是因为最佳而没有进行居中吗？ 

595
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:25,250
PROFESSOR: Because I claim that, in an optimal strategy,
教授：因为我主张以最佳策略， 

596
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,240
you wouldn't have it.
你不会有它。 

597
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,059
But you don't have to take my word for it.
但是您不必相信我的话。 

598
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:30,059
If you don't believe me, then you add center.
如果您不相信我，那么请添加中心。 

599
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:32,109
And you just have more possibilities.
而且您还有更多的可能性。 

600
00:25:32,109 --> 00:25:34,219
And if it happens to not be an optimal thing,
如果碰巧不是最佳选择， 

601
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:37,259
then the dynamic programming will ignore it.
那么动态编程将忽略它。 

602
00:25:37,259 --> 00:25:40,859
So how many positions do I have if I add center?
那么，如果添加中心，我将拥有几个职位？ 

603
00:25:40,859 --> 00:25:44,098
So if I have left, center, right for each position.
因此，如果我在每个位置都左，中，右。 

604
00:25:44,098 --> 00:25:44,639
AUDIENCE: 75.
观众：75。 

605
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,140



606
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:47,806
PROFESSOR: Cool.
教授：太好了。 

607
00:25:47,806 --> 00:25:50,640



608
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,194
Yes.
是。 

609
00:25:51,394 --> 00:25:53,452
AUDIENCE: So why is it 25?
观众：那为什么是25？ 

610
00:25:53,452 --> 00:25:56,944
You wouldn't actually have both of your feet on the right.
实际上，您实际上不会双脚都在右边。 

611
00:25:56,944 --> 00:25:57,569
PROFESSOR: Why?
教授：为什么？ 

612
00:25:57,569 --> 00:26:00,429



613
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:03,720
Maybe, well especially, for maximizing this one actually.
也许，尤其是为了最大限度地提高这一能力。 

614
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,799
Especially for maximizing entertainment.
特别是为了最大程度地提高娱乐性。 

615
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:10,514
Then it's way cooler to do this, right?
然后这样做比较酷，对吗？ 

616
00:26:10,515 --> 00:26:12,629
[LAUGHTER]
 [笑声] 

617
00:26:12,829 --> 00:26:13,579
You get the point.
你明白了。 

618
00:26:13,579 --> 00:26:14,745
AUDIENCE: --possible weight.
听众：-可能的体重。 

619
00:26:14,746 --> 00:26:16,757
Like combinations for like, where is
相似组合的相似之处在哪里

620
00:26:16,757 --> 00:26:18,139
you should have your feet at one time.
你应该一次站起来。 

621
00:26:18,339 --> 00:26:20,763
Like, not necessarily what the game is asking you to do.
喜欢，不一定是游戏要你做什么。 

622
00:26:20,763 --> 00:26:21,429
PROFESSOR: Yeah.
教授：是的。 

623
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:25,039
So this is where my feet are.
这就是我的脚所在。 

624
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,963
The game will always ask something like this.
游戏总是会问这样的事情。 

625
00:26:26,963 --> 00:26:29,129
So the game won't always care about both of my feet.
所以游戏不会总是在乎我的双脚。 

626
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:30,930
Sometimes it'll only care about one foot.
有时只关心一只脚。 

627
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:33,240



628
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:33,740
So, yeah.
是的。 

629
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:35,405
There are two different concepts, right?
有两个不同的概念，对吗？ 

630
00:26:35,405 --> 00:26:37,899
There's the position of my feet.
这是我脚的位置。 

631
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:40,479
And then there's the note on the screen.
然后屏幕上有笔记。 

632
00:26:40,479 --> 00:26:42,519
And my feet have to match the note on the screen.
而且我的脚必须与屏幕上的音符匹配。 

633
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:45,500
And we'll have to capture that somehow.
而且，我们必须以某种方式捕获它。 

634
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,369
So what's in a state?
那么状态如何？ 

635
00:26:48,369 --> 00:26:50,168
What are my decisions?
我的决定是什么？ 

636
00:26:50,169 --> 00:26:50,710
Come on, now.
快点

637
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:53,779
We should be in a good shape to know what my decisions are.
我们应该处于良好状态，以了解我的决定。 

638
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:54,990
What do I decide every time?
我每次都决定什么？ 

639
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:57,905



640
00:26:57,905 --> 00:27:00,033
AUDIENCE: What move to make?
听众：采取什么措施？ 

641
00:27:00,034 --> 00:27:00,700
PROFESSOR: Yeah.
教授：是的。 

642
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:01,950
How am I going to jump, right?
我怎么跳，对吗？ 

643
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:05,509
Where my feet are going to be in the new position.
我的脚将要处于新的位置。 

644
00:27:05,509 --> 00:27:12,569
So every time, I'm deciding what's the new foot position.
所以每次，我都在决定新的脚位置。 

645
00:27:12,569 --> 00:27:14,809
AUDIENCE: Aren't you also deciding weight position,
听众：您不是也在决定体重位置吗？ 

646
00:27:14,809 --> 00:27:17,156
where you're going to hold to, right?
你要坚持的地方，对不对？ 

647
00:27:17,156 --> 00:27:17,740
PROFESSOR: OK.
教授：好的。 

648
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:21,240
So when I say foot position, it's a cheat for everything.
因此，当我说脚步姿势时，一切都是骗人的。 

649
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,380



650
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:24,880
So yeah.
是的。 

651
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,650
Good observation.
好观察。 

652
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:29,359
OK.
好。 

653
00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:33,679
What do I need to know, in order to make this decision?
我需要知道什么才能做出此决定？ 

654
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:38,029



655
00:27:38,029 --> 00:27:39,450
OK.
好。 

656
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:41,450
I would need to know where I was before
我需要知道我以前在哪里

657
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:43,419
if I want to compute the difficulties.
如果我想计算困难。 

658
00:27:43,619 --> 00:27:45,750
But aside from that-- what?
但是除此之外-什么？ 

659
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:48,539
AUDIENCE: Sir, it came up with this polynomial.
听众：主席先生，它提出了这个多项式。 

660
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:50,450
PROFESSOR: All right.
教授：好的。 

661
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:53,698
AUDIENCE: Is that a hint to what the run time of this will be?
听众：这是否暗示了它的运行时间？ 

662
00:27:53,898 --> 00:27:55,189
PROFESSOR: It's not on purpose.
教授：这不是故意的。 

663
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:57,399
But yes.
但是，是的。 

664
00:27:57,599 --> 00:27:58,949
So, yeah.
是的。 

665
00:27:58,950 --> 00:27:59,730
That makes sense.
那讲得通。 

666
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:00,220
Probably not good.
可能不好。 

667
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,303
I should probably not have my screen up without me
没有我，我可能不应该把屏幕关起来

668
00:28:02,303 --> 00:28:04,369
looking at it.
看着它。 

669
00:28:04,569 --> 00:28:05,509
OK, so.
好吧

670
00:28:05,509 --> 00:28:07,720
Back to decisions.
回到决定。 

671
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:10,529
I think I want to know what's going to be on the screen
我想我想知道屏幕上会发生什么

672
00:28:10,529 --> 00:28:11,349
when I land, right?
当我降落时，对不对？ 

673
00:28:11,349 --> 00:28:15,119
Because if the screen says, yo, you need to go up and down.
因为如果屏幕上显示“哟”，那么您需要上下移动。 

674
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:17,871
Then maybe I shouldn't do this, right?
那也许我不应该这样做，对吗？ 

675
00:28:17,872 --> 00:28:18,629
That would not be good.
那不是很好。 

676
00:28:18,829 --> 00:28:21,619



677
00:28:21,619 --> 00:28:24,459
So I need to know what the note is going to be when I land.
所以我需要知道降落时的音符会是什么。 

678
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:27,131



679
00:28:27,131 --> 00:28:27,630
Note.
注意。 

680
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:31,117



681
00:28:31,317 --> 00:28:33,724
AUDIENCE: Is that the same as the next?
听众：与下一个相同吗？ 

682
00:28:33,724 --> 00:28:34,349
PROFESSOR: Yep.
教授：是的。 

683
00:28:34,349 --> 00:28:35,359
Next note.
下一个音符。 

684
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:36,479
Yes.
是。 

685
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,049
So the next note here on the screen.
因此屏幕上的下一个音符。 

686
00:28:39,049 --> 00:28:42,879
So, my position in this list, basically.
因此，基本上，我在这份名单中的位置。 

687
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,296
AUDIENCE: So it's kind of like the knapsack problem, where
听众：这有点像背包问题， 

688
00:28:45,296 --> 00:28:48,005
it's like which thing we're considering picking up.
就像我们要考虑的事情。 

689
00:28:48,005 --> 00:28:51,470
But in this case, it's coming [INAUDIBLE].
但是在这种情况下，它即将[听不清]。 

690
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:53,720
PROFESSOR: So it's close to knapsack.
教授：因此，它接近背包。 

691
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:56,970
But the difference is, in knapsack, I
但是不同的是，在背包里，我

692
00:28:56,970 --> 00:29:02,680
have to decide, do I choose this or do I ignore it.
必须决定，我选择这个还是忽略它。 

693
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:11,778
So, if I'd be like, if I can only do a few things
所以，如果我愿意，我只能做几件事

694
00:29:11,778 --> 00:29:13,319
and I want to maximize my score, then
我想最大化自己的分数，然后

695
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:14,869
maybe I would choose, all right.
也许我会选择，好的。 

696
00:29:14,869 --> 00:29:15,449
This is easy.
这很容易。 

697
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:16,240
I'm going to do it.
我要去做

698
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:16,869
This is hard.
这很难。 

699
00:29:16,869 --> 00:29:17,369
Screw it.
算了。 

700
00:29:17,369 --> 00:29:17,859
This is easy.
这很容易。 

701
00:29:17,859 --> 00:29:18,650
I'm going to do it.
我要去做

702
00:29:18,651 --> 00:29:20,779
So then my decisions are 0, 1.
所以我的决定是0，1。 

703
00:29:20,779 --> 00:29:22,609
Pick or not pick.
选择还是不选择。 

704
00:29:22,609 --> 00:29:24,519
In this case, every time my decision
在这种情况下，每次我的决定

705
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:25,869
is a new state of my feet.
是我脚下的一种新状态。 

706
00:29:25,869 --> 00:29:27,045
So it's not 0, 1.
因此它不是0、1。 

707
00:29:27,046 --> 00:29:27,659
AUDIENCE: OK.
听众：好的。 

708
00:29:27,859 --> 00:29:29,259
PROFESSOR: That's the difference.
教授：就是这样。 

709
00:29:29,259 --> 00:29:31,309
And then, because of that, the state
然后，因此，国家

710
00:29:31,309 --> 00:29:32,569
is going to look different.
看起来会有所不同。 

711
00:29:32,569 --> 00:29:34,519
And the recursion's will look a bit different.
递归的看起来会有所不同。 

712
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:40,740



713
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,240
OK.
好。 

714
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,710
So I want to know the note that I'm landing at.
所以我想知道我要降落的音符。 

715
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:46,845
I want to know the sum of-- well,
我想知道-嗯， 

716
00:29:46,845 --> 00:29:48,970
we'll see if I want to know the sum of difficulties
我们看看我是否想知道困难的总和

717
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:50,230
up to this point.
到这一点。 

718
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:53,730
And I want to know one more thing, so.
我还想知道一件事。 

719
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:56,309
If this is going to be my new state,
如果这将是我的新状态， 

720
00:29:56,309 --> 00:30:00,899
and I know what note I'm landing at, I'm making a decision.
而且我知道我要下注，我正在做决定。 

721
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:04,240
The decision tells me where my feet are going to be.
这个决定告诉我我的脚在哪里。 

722
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,319



723
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:07,819
Right?
对？ 

724
00:30:07,819 --> 00:30:10,389
The move decides where my feet are going to be.
此举决定了我的脚在哪里。 

725
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:12,640
What do I need to do?
我需要做什么？ 

726
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,672
What else do I need to know for my total solution?
我的总体解决方案还需要了解什么？ 

727
00:30:16,672 --> 00:30:19,005
So what do I need to know to consider between decisions?
那么我需要知道哪些才能在决定之间进行考虑？ 

728
00:30:19,005 --> 00:30:24,500



729
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:31,289
So say I'm considering the state of-- I'm at note two.
所以说我正在考虑状态–我在第二点。 

730
00:30:31,289 --> 00:30:35,750
Note two says, left right.
注意二说，从左到右。 

731
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:38,789
And I'm considering of coming here
我正在考虑来这里

732
00:30:38,789 --> 00:30:44,700
from note one, where my foot position was up down.
从注一看，我的脚的位置向下。 

733
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:48,509
Or come here from note one, where
或者从注释一来这里

734
00:30:48,509 --> 00:30:52,269
my foot position was left right.
我的脚的位置是左右。 

735
00:30:52,269 --> 00:30:57,671



736
00:30:57,671 --> 00:30:59,420
I need to know where my foot position was,
我要知道脚的位置

737
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,650
to choose between these, right?
在这些之间选择，对不对？ 

738
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:03,795
If I don't know that, then I can't choose.
如果我不知道，那我就选择不了。 

739
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:06,170
AUDIENCE: That's not from your state, though?
听众：那不是你的状态吗？ 

740
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:07,115
PROFESSOR: Not yet.
教授：还没有。 

741
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:09,009
It's not here, so it's not part of my state.
它不在这里，所以这不是我的状态的一部分。 

742
00:31:09,009 --> 00:31:11,569
We've been talking about it a lot, but we didn't put it here.
我们一直在谈论它，但是我们没有把它放在这里。 

743
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:13,069
So let's say that the state is going
假设国家正在发展

744
00:31:13,069 --> 00:31:14,639
to have the note that I'm landing at.
有我要降落的音符。 

745
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,349
And my foot position after landing.
和我着陆后的脚位置。 

746
00:31:18,549 --> 00:31:28,129



747
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:32,899
So, if I know that I'm going to land like this,
所以，如果我知道我要像这样降落， 

748
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:35,529
then I know where I was here. l r.
然后我知道我在这里。拉河

749
00:31:35,529 --> 00:31:37,920
Say, l r.
说，河。 

750
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,650
I can compute the costs here, right?
我可以在这里计算成本，对不对？ 

751
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:47,009
This is delta of going from this to this.
这是从此到此的增量。 

752
00:31:47,009 --> 00:31:53,641
And this is the delta for going from this to this.
这是从此到此的增量。 

753
00:31:53,641 --> 00:31:54,539
Can you see?
你知道吗？ 

754
00:31:54,539 --> 00:31:55,289
Is that too small?
那太小了吗？ 

755
00:31:55,289 --> 00:31:59,599



756
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:02,209
Delta wants to know where my feet were before.
三角洲想知道我的脚在哪里。 

757
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:03,910
And where they're going to be now.
以及他们现在要去的地方。 

758
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:06,089
So when I call it, I need to know where I was before.
因此，当我打电话给我时，我需要知道我以前在哪里。 

759
00:32:06,289 --> 00:32:08,164
And I need to know where I'm going to be now.
我需要知道我现在要去哪里。 

760
00:32:08,164 --> 00:32:11,359
So this should be part of my state.
所以这应该是我的状态的一部分。 

761
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:15,139
So our decision says, what's my new position going to be?
所以我们的决定说，我的新职位是什么？ 

762
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:18,409
So when I make a move, I influence my new foot position.
因此，当我移动时，会影响我的新脚位置。 

763
00:32:18,609 --> 00:32:20,449
They're going to be in someplace.
他们将在某个地方。 

764
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:25,241
And independently of that, the note-- the position here--
而且与此无关，该音符-此处的位置- 

765
00:32:25,241 --> 00:32:27,575
the position of the note, increases all the time, right?
音符的位置一直在增加，对吗？ 

766
00:32:27,575 --> 00:32:28,990
Because time can only go forwards.
因为时间只能前进。 

767
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:32,910



768
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:35,009
How are we going to account for these extra moves?
我们将如何考虑这些额外的举动？ 

769
00:32:35,009 --> 00:32:38,689



770
00:32:38,689 --> 00:32:40,824
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].
听众：[听不清]。 

771
00:32:40,824 --> 00:32:42,990
PROFESSOR: So, we said that between every two notes,
教授：所以，我们说在每两个音符之间， 

772
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:45,200
we might want to make one extra move.
我们可能要多采取一些行动。 

773
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:50,639



774
00:32:50,839 --> 00:32:53,091
AUDIENCE: Like, a potential new note
听众：喜欢，一个潜在的新音符

775
00:32:53,092 --> 00:32:56,409
in between your destination note?
在目的地注释之间？ 

776
00:32:56,609 --> 00:32:57,442
PROFESSOR: Yep.
教授：是的。 

777
00:32:57,442 --> 00:33:00,384
AUDIENCE: And then just fill in the difficulties for that
听众：然后填写相关的困难

778
00:33:00,384 --> 00:33:01,349
and see which ones--
看看哪个- 

779
00:33:01,349 --> 00:33:03,849
PROFESSOR: So, if I want to use the algorithm that I already
教授：所以，如果我想使用已经存在的算法

780
00:33:03,849 --> 00:33:07,089
have, that compares my landing position to my note,
可以比较我的着陆位置和我的笔记， 

781
00:33:07,089 --> 00:33:10,470
to see whether I can go there or not, what note would
看看我是否可以去那里，那张纸条会

782
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:14,670
I want to put in that intermediate note?
我要插入中间注释吗？ 

783
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:18,750
So, you're basically saying that between every two notes,
因此，您基本上是说，在每两个音符之间， 

784
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,559
I'm going to have one more note.
我还要再记一下。 

785
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:24,903
And my feet can be wherever here.
我的脚可以在这里的任何地方。 

786
00:33:24,903 --> 00:33:25,443
AUDIENCE: Oh.
听众：哦。 

787
00:33:25,443 --> 00:33:28,228
I mean, you'll also have the edge originally
我的意思是，你本来也有优势

788
00:33:28,228 --> 00:33:30,549
connecting them.
连接他们。 

789
00:33:30,549 --> 00:33:32,819
So, you'd have it going to the intermediate note,
因此，您可以将其转到中间音符， 

790
00:33:32,819 --> 00:33:34,069
but also from the destination.
而且从目的地出发

791
00:33:34,069 --> 00:33:35,762
Yeah, like that.
是的，那样。 

792
00:33:35,762 --> 00:33:38,069
You'd have to--
您必须- 

793
00:33:38,069 --> 00:33:42,629
PROFESSOR: So, what note would I have here?
教授：那我在这里要注意些什么？ 

794
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:44,556
AUDIENCE: It makes you go to the center.
听众：它使您可以进入中心。 

795
00:33:44,556 --> 00:33:46,000
PROFESSOR: Do I have to be at the center?
教授：我必须在中心吗？ 

796
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,369
AUDIENCE: Well, you can be anywhere.
听众：好吧，你可以在任何地方。 

797
00:33:47,369 --> 00:33:48,035
PROFESSOR: Yeah.
教授：是的。 

798
00:33:48,036 --> 00:33:50,900
So I'm going to invent the blank note.
因此，我将发明空白便笺。 

799
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:53,159
That's a big O. That means you can do whatever you want.
那是一个很大的O。这意味着您可以做任何您想做的事。 

800
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:54,819
There are no constraints.
没有任何限制。 

801
00:33:54,819 --> 00:33:56,799
So that is just an intermediary state.
因此，这只是一个中介状态。 

802
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:00,789
So then I'm going to take this input,
因此，我将接受此输入， 

803
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:03,710
and I'm going to add these blank notes here.
我将在此处添加这些空白便笺。 

804
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:05,690
And these map to adding notes in the graph.
这些映射到图中添加注释。 

805
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:11,025



806
00:34:11,025 --> 00:34:12,483
AUDIENCE: Well, then, when you just
听众：那么，当你

807
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:16,319
run through your difficulty function between each two notes
在每两个音符之间运行难度函数

808
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,653
and see if, for all the potential moves, which
并查看所有潜在移动是否

809
00:34:20,853 --> 00:34:23,655
one minimizes that path.
一个使路径最小化。 

810
00:34:23,655 --> 00:34:25,059
PROFESSOR: Yep.
教授：是的。 

811
00:34:25,059 --> 00:34:27,190
So basically, I'm assuming I don't need this.
所以基本上，我假设我不需要这个。 

812
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:30,065
I'm assuming that.
我以为是。 

813
00:34:30,065 --> 00:34:31,440
This is going to be where there's
这将是那里

814
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,989
at least one choice where this is going
至少要这样做的一个选择

815
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:37,376
to have the same cost as a direct note.
具有与直接记录相同的费用。 

816
00:34:37,376 --> 00:34:38,960
And then I'm going to say that instead
然后我要说的是

817
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,260
of having more complex shapes in the graph,
在图形中具有更复杂的形状

818
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:45,938
I'm going to insert extra moves here.
我将在此处插入其他动作。 

819
00:34:46,137 --> 00:34:46,679
AUDIENCE: OK.
听众：好的。 

820
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:49,052
I would think that, if you have an intermediate move that
我认为，如果您采取中间措施， 

821
00:34:49,052 --> 00:34:52,569
might be less expensive, you should, like, just
可能会便宜一些，您应该只是

822
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:54,411
hop to that new position than to have
跳到那个新位置而不是拥有

823
00:34:54,411 --> 00:34:56,173
an intermediate move, right?
中间动作吧？ 

824
00:34:56,373 --> 00:34:57,039
PROFESSOR: Yeah.
教授：是的。 

825
00:34:57,039 --> 00:35:00,375
And I'm going to assume that either that's not the case,
我将假设不是这样， 

826
00:35:00,375 --> 00:35:02,500
or that I can always find an intermediate move that
或我总能找到一个中间步骤

827
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,289
makes my life better.
使我的生活变得更好。 

828
00:35:05,289 --> 00:35:06,563
AUDIENCE: Every case?
听众：每种情况？ 

829
00:35:06,563 --> 00:35:07,230
PROFESSOR: Yeah.
教授：是的。 

830
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:12,786



831
00:35:12,786 --> 00:35:14,255
PROFESSOR: These results do work.
教授：这些结果确实有用。 

832
00:35:14,255 --> 00:35:16,380
You'll have to take my word for it that this works.
您必须接受我的保证。 

833
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,860
And this makes your dynamic programming easy.
这使动态编程变得容易。 

834
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:21,500
And it makes your graph building easy.
它使您的图形构建变得容易。 

835
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:24,369
So the advantage of this is you're changing the input.
因此，这样做的好处是您可以更改输入。 

836
00:35:24,369 --> 00:35:26,159
And then, when you're building your graph
然后，当您建立图表时

837
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:28,000
or when you're doing the DP, you only
或在执行DP时，仅

838
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,429
worry about an input that looks like this.
担心输入看起来像这样。 

839
00:35:30,429 --> 00:35:32,719
You don't care about any intermediate stuff.
您不在乎任何中间的东西。 

840
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:35,269
You have notes, and you have to transition between the notes.
您有注释，并且必须在注释之间转换。 

841
00:35:35,269 --> 00:35:36,239
Period.
期。 

842
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:39,364
So we reduce the complexity of the problem.
因此，我们降低了问题的复杂性。 

843
00:35:39,364 --> 00:35:41,739
So whenever you can get away with that, it's really nice.
因此，只要您能摆脱它，那真的很好。 

844
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:43,969
We can do that for centering.
我们可以做到居中。 

845
00:35:43,969 --> 00:35:46,529
We might not be able to do it for other more complicated
我们可能无法完成其他更复杂的操作

846
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:47,028
stuff.
东西。 

847
00:35:47,028 --> 00:35:50,360



848
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,789
OK.
好。 

849
00:35:52,989 --> 00:35:57,729
So, we sort of know what we want in a state.
因此，我们有点知道某种状态下的需求。 

850
00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:00,949
Now we want to build a graph, so that the path
现在我们要建立一个图，这样路径

851
00:36:00,949 --> 00:36:05,139
from some source to some destination
从某个来源到某个目的地

852
00:36:05,139 --> 00:36:10,969
has a cost that's equivalent to the sum of these difficulties.
所付出的代价等于这些困难的总和。 

853
00:36:10,969 --> 00:36:11,469
Right?
对？ 

854
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:13,219
Because then I can run the shortest path.
因为这样我才能走最短的路。 

855
00:36:13,219 --> 00:36:17,329
And my solution will be right there.
我的解决方案就在那里。 

856
00:36:17,329 --> 00:36:17,829
I know.
我知道。 

857
00:36:17,829 --> 00:36:18,949
You guys seem awfully sad.
你们似乎很难过。 

858
00:36:18,949 --> 00:36:21,969
Do you want to take a break and play for a little bit more?
您想休息一下再玩吗？ 

859
00:36:21,969 --> 00:36:24,789
Yes?
是？ 

860
00:36:24,789 --> 00:36:28,797
How many people want to play, instead of.
想玩多少人，而不是。 

861
00:36:28,797 --> 00:36:30,130
You don't have to play yourself.
您不必扮演自己。 

862
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:32,519
You can just rest for these two or three minutes.
您可以休息两三分钟。 

863
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:34,219
And you can watch someone else play.
您可以看别人玩。 

864
00:36:34,219 --> 00:36:37,310
And get more intuition about how you're supposed to play.
并获得更多关于您应该如何比赛的直觉。 

865
00:36:37,311 --> 00:36:39,740



866
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:40,239
OK.
好。 

867
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,819
So one person wants to take a break.
所以一个人想休息一下。 

868
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,110
Everyone else wants to keep going?
其他人都想继续吗？ 

869
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:44,440
Or are you guys passed out already?
还是你们已经昏倒了？ 

870
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,731
AUDIENCE: Can we get out early?
听众：我们可以早点离开吗？ 

871
00:36:45,731 --> 00:36:48,170



872
00:36:48,369 --> 00:36:49,920
PROFESSOR: Sort of.
教授：有点。 

873
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,420
Yeah.
是的

874
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,878
You'll get out three minutes early,
你会提前三分钟出去

875
00:36:51,878 --> 00:36:55,210
if we don't do another round.
如果我们不做另一轮。 

876
00:36:55,409 --> 00:36:57,932
So who wants to keep going?
那么谁愿意继续前进呢？ 

877
00:36:57,932 --> 00:36:58,474
AUDIENCE: No.
听众：不。 

878
00:36:58,474 --> 00:37:00,856
Let's play.
让我们玩。 

879
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:01,639
PROFESSOR: OK.
教授：好的。 

880
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:02,764
So who wants to keep going?
那么谁愿意继续前进呢？ 

881
00:37:02,764 --> 00:37:04,240
You can only vote on one thing.
您只能对一件事投票。 

882
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:04,989
Who wants to play?
谁想玩？ 

883
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:08,296



884
00:37:08,297 --> 00:37:08,838
AUDIENCE: OK.
听众：好的。 

885
00:37:08,838 --> 00:37:09,463
AUDIENCE: Five.
听众：五。 

886
00:37:09,463 --> 00:37:10,960
AUDIENCE: Four.
听众：四。 

887
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,099
AUDIENCE: Victor, go.
听众：维克多，走。 

888
00:37:12,099 --> 00:37:13,049
PROFESSOR: OK.
教授：好的。 

889
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:15,480
Who wants to go?
谁想去？ 

890
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:18,329
So we decided what we're going to have in notes.
因此，我们决定了笔记中将要包含的内容。 

891
00:37:18,329 --> 00:37:20,730
And we're going to build a graph, where
我们将建立一个图形

892
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:22,199
the notes are the states.
笔记是状态。 

893
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:23,829
And the edges are the moves.
而边缘就是动作。 

894
00:37:23,829 --> 00:37:25,630
Right?
对？ 

895
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:29,300
So a note tells me, just like there, what note I'm at.
因此，有一个音符告诉我，就像在那儿一样。 

896
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,440
Say I'm at note two.
说我在第二注。 

897
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,440
And where my feet are on.
而我的脚在哪里。 

898
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,320
So, left foot left.
所以，左脚离开。 

899
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,289
Right foot right.
右脚右。 

900
00:37:36,289 --> 00:37:38,820



901
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:42,269
So, given a state, what outgoing edges do I build?
因此，给定状态，我要构建哪些输出边缘？ 

902
00:37:42,269 --> 00:37:43,949
Where can I go to?
我可以去哪里？ 

903
00:37:43,949 --> 00:37:47,480
So let's say I have a state that says I'm at note n
假设我有一个状态，说我在音符n 

904
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,320
and my left foot is in some position.
我的左脚在某个位置。 

905
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:53,000
My right foot is in some position.
我的右脚处于某个位置。 

906
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,655
What are my outgoing edges from here?
我从这里出去的边缘是什么？ 

907
00:37:55,655 --> 00:37:58,340
AUDIENCE: Is there an outgoing edge to every move?
听众：每一步都有外向的优势吗？ 

908
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,297
Because there's a point.
因为有一点。 

909
00:37:59,496 --> 00:38:00,079
PROFESSOR: OK.
教授：好的。 

910
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:03,869



911
00:38:03,869 --> 00:38:05,460
Well, actually, the blank is a note, right?
好吧，实际上，空格是一个音符，对吗？ 

912
00:38:05,659 --> 00:38:09,750
So if the next note, if note three's a blank,
因此，如果下一个音符，如果音符三为空白， 

913
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:11,610
then the note is a blank.
那么便笺为空白。 

914
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:13,463
And then I can have.
然后我可以拥有。 

915
00:38:13,463 --> 00:38:16,469
AUDIENCE: I guess, isn't the difficulty
听众：我想这不是难事

916
00:38:16,469 --> 00:38:21,584
of the move dependent on what note that blank actually is?
此举取决于空白实际上是什么？ 

917
00:38:21,585 --> 00:38:23,960
PROFESSOR: So, it doesn't depend on what the screen says.
教授：因此，这并不取决于屏幕上显示的内容。 

918
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:27,231
It depends on where my feet are.
这取决于我的脚在哪里。 

919
00:38:27,231 --> 00:38:27,940
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.
听众：哦，好。 

920
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:28,463
I see.
我懂了。 

921
00:38:28,463 --> 00:38:29,880
PROFESSOR: So I have a number that
教授：所以我有一个数字

922
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,690
tells me what's on my screen.
告诉我屏幕上的内容。 

923
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:33,980
This number is enough for me to know
这个数字足以让我知道

924
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:36,610
what's going to be on my screen from now on until forever.
从现在开始一直到永远在我的屏幕上显示什么。 

925
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:39,079
Because I have the list ahead of time.
因为我事先有清单。 

926
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:41,009
And then I have the position of my feet.
然后我有了脚的位置。 

927
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:43,300
So these are both part of the state.
因此，这些都是国家的一部分。 

928
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,110
So I have notes for all the notes.
所以我有所有笔记的笔记。 

929
00:38:45,309 --> 00:38:47,469
And all the positions of the feet.
以及脚的所有位置。 

930
00:38:47,469 --> 00:38:49,269
AUDIENCE: Right.
听众：对。 

931
00:38:49,269 --> 00:38:55,239
But the blank note is just one position of feet?
但是空白便笺只是脚的一个位置？ 

932
00:38:55,239 --> 00:38:56,009
PROFESSOR: No.
教授：不。 

933
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:56,920
AUDIENCE: Or, it's all positions.
听众：或者，所有职位。 

934
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:57,319
PROFESSOR: Yeah.
教授：是的。 

935
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,923
AUDIENCE: Isn't the difficulty dependent
听众：不依赖于难度

936
00:38:59,123 --> 00:39:01,013
on what position your feet end up?
您的脚最终处于什么位置？ 

937
00:39:01,014 --> 00:39:01,480
PROFESSOR: Yeah.
教授：是的。 

938
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:03,690
So it's from where I start to where I land.
所以这是从我开始到登陆的地方。 

939
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:14,030
So, if I decide to start from here, and go here,
所以，如果我决定从这里开始，然后去这里， 

940
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:17,880
the difficulty of this move is-- so it doesn't depend on
此举的困难在于-因此它并不取决于

941
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:20,519
whether I have a blank there.
我那里是否有空白。 

942
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:21,449
And this was OK.
没关系。 

943
00:39:21,449 --> 00:39:24,319
Or, if I had an up down, then I just missed the note.
或者，如果我情绪低落，那么我只是错过了笔记。 

944
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,920
But the difficulty, the effort I'm expending, is the same.
但是困难，我正在付出的努力，是相同的。 

945
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:28,119
AUDIENCE: OK.
听众：好的。 

946
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:31,119
But if you start from that other move and go to a different
但是，如果您从其他步骤开始，然后转到其他位置

947
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:32,150
position, that's--
位置- 

948
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:34,059
PROFESSOR: If I go from this to this,
教授：如果我从这个转到这个， 

949
00:39:34,059 --> 00:39:35,746
then that's a different difficulty.
那是另外一个困难。 

950
00:39:35,746 --> 00:39:38,608
AUDIENCE: But it still could be a blank note?
听众：但这还是空白吗？ 

951
00:39:38,608 --> 00:39:39,569
PROFESSOR: Yeah.
教授：是的。 

952
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:42,025
So, a blank note will let me go wherever I want.
因此，空白便笺可以让我随心所欲。 

953
00:39:42,025 --> 00:39:43,630
AUDIENCE: I see.
听众：我明白了。 

954
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:49,097
But there are different kinds of blank notes, with different--
但是有不同种类的空白便笺，其中- 

955
00:39:49,097 --> 00:39:50,717
I guess I'm confused as to what--
我想我对什么感到困惑- 

956
00:39:50,717 --> 00:39:51,300
PROFESSOR: OK.
教授：好的。 

957
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,391
So let's go through them again.
因此，让我们再次浏览它们。 

958
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:55,199
AUDIENCE: Is it kind of like it's, like, spreading,
听众：是不是像传播， 

959
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:58,859
so really when you have your source note,
所以当您有原始记录时， 

960
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:02,460
it's actually connecting to every possible move.
它实际上与所有可能的动作都息息相关。 

961
00:40:02,659 --> 00:40:05,079
And every possible move is connecting to your next--
而且所有可能的举措都在连接您的下一个- 

962
00:40:05,079 --> 00:40:06,913
so it's kind of like a diamond shaped thing?
所以有点像菱形的东西？ 

963
00:40:06,913 --> 00:40:08,684



964
00:40:08,684 --> 00:40:09,559
PROFESSOR: Not quite.
教授：不完全是。 

965
00:40:09,559 --> 00:40:10,429
Not quite.
不完全的。 

966
00:40:10,429 --> 00:40:12,219
So, let's go through the notes again.
因此，让我们再次浏览笔记。 

967
00:40:12,219 --> 00:40:13,730
And then let's go through that.
然后让我们来看一下。 

968
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:16,030
So the source move will be connected to some notes.
因此，源动作将与某些音符相关。 

969
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:18,280
And then those notes will be connected to other notes.
然后这些笔记将被连接到其他笔记。 

970
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:21,289
And it looks more like you have a big, outgoing degree.
而且看起来您的学历很高。 

971
00:40:21,489 --> 00:40:22,835
Then you have a big network.
然后，您将拥有一个庞大的网络。 

972
00:40:22,835 --> 00:40:24,084
Then the big, incoming degree.
然后是大的传入度。 

973
00:40:24,085 --> 00:40:27,081
It looks like a messed up sorting network.
它看起来像一个混乱的分拣网络。 

974
00:40:27,081 --> 00:40:28,164
So, notes are constraints.
因此，注释是约束。 

975
00:40:28,164 --> 00:40:31,050



976
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:34,230
This accepts any possible feet combination, right?
这接受任何可能的脚组合，对吗？ 

977
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:38,829
So this accepts this.
因此，这接受了这一点。 

978
00:40:38,829 --> 00:40:40,311
AUDIENCE: Is the first combination
听众：是第一个组合

979
00:40:40,311 --> 00:40:42,781
contained in that note?
该说明中包含？ 

980
00:40:42,782 --> 00:40:43,606
In that blank note?
在那空白的笔记里？ 

981
00:40:43,606 --> 00:40:44,190
PROFESSOR: No.
教授：不。 

982
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:45,273
The blank is a constraint.
空白是一个约束。 

983
00:40:45,273 --> 00:40:47,400



984
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:51,170
So, if I have a note that looks like this, then
所以，如果我有一个像这样的笔记， 

985
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:54,590
if one of my feet is here and the other one is in the center,
如果我的一只脚在这里，另一只脚在中间， 

986
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:55,750
then that's fine.
那很好

987
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:57,516
The constraint is met.
满足约束。 

988
00:40:57,516 --> 00:40:59,599
If one of my feet is up and the other one is down,
如果我的一只脚举起而另一只脚举起， 

989
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:02,110
then the constraint is met.
然后满足约束。 

990
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:04,652
AUDIENCE: But the edge running into that blank note,
听众：但是边缘碰到了空白的钞票， 

991
00:41:04,652 --> 00:41:09,976
depending on how your feet land, is different difficulty.
根据脚的着陆方式，难度有所不同。 

992
00:41:09,976 --> 00:41:10,943
Is that right?
那正确吗？ 

993
00:41:10,943 --> 00:41:12,409
PROFESSOR: Yep.
教授：是的。 

994
00:41:12,409 --> 00:41:13,980
But when I compute the edge width,
但是当我计算边缘宽度时

995
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:16,590
I need to know where I'm landing exactly.
我需要确切地知道我要降落在哪里。 

996
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:18,769
Not just where the note is because the note might
不仅是笔记所在的地方，因为笔记可能

997
00:41:18,769 --> 00:41:20,250
admit multiple positions.
接受多个职位。 

998
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:21,077
AUDIENCE: I see.
听众：我明白了。 

999
00:41:21,077 --> 00:41:22,710
PROFESSOR: So this guy admits all positions.
教授：所以这个人承认所有职位。 

1000
00:41:22,909 --> 00:41:23,940
AUDIENCE: OK.
听众：好的。 

1001
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:26,050
PROFESSOR: This guy admits some positions, right?
教授：这个人承认一些职位，对吗？ 

1002
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:27,940
These are l r, l r.
这些是lr，l r。 

1003
00:41:28,139 --> 00:41:33,150
If I have up down, how many feet positions does it admit?
如果我仰卧起坐，它可以容纳多少脚？ 

1004
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:33,914
AUDIENCE: Just one.
听众：一个。 

1005
00:41:34,114 --> 00:41:34,989
PROFESSOR: Not great.
教授：不好。 

1006
00:41:34,989 --> 00:41:36,829
AUDIENCE: No.
听众：不。 

1007
00:41:36,829 --> 00:41:38,909
PROFESSOR: How many?
教授：多少？ 

1008
00:41:38,909 --> 00:41:41,443
AUDIENCE: As an intermediate?
听众：作为中间人？ 

1009
00:41:41,443 --> 00:41:43,610
PROFESSOR: If it's up down, then it's on the screen.
教授：如果它向下，则它在屏幕上。 

1010
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:44,701
My intermediates are all blank.
我的中间体都是空白的。 

1011
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:45,653
AUDIENCE: Oh, oh.
听众：哦，哦。 

1012
00:41:45,653 --> 00:41:47,844
I thought you were saying start with that.
我以为你是从那开始。 

1013
00:41:47,844 --> 00:41:48,760
PROFESSOR: So up down.
教授：那么下来。 

1014
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,135
If you see up down on the screen,
如果您在屏幕上向上看， 

1015
00:41:50,135 --> 00:41:51,360
how many feet positions?
多少脚位置？ 

1016
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,440
AUDIENCE: Left to right what it could have.
听众：从左到右可能会有什么。 

1017
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:53,420
PROFESSOR: Yep.
教授：是的。 

1018
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:56,210
So, if the screen says up down, the only two ways
因此，如果屏幕上下显示，只有两种方法

1019
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:58,539
I can do that is this.
我可以做到的就是这个。 

1020
00:41:58,739 --> 00:41:59,439
Or this.
或这个。 

1021
00:41:59,440 --> 00:41:59,940
Right?
对？ 

1022
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:00,554
So, two positions.
因此，有两个职位。 

1023
00:42:00,554 --> 00:42:01,346
AUDIENCE: I see.
听众：我明白了。 

1024
00:42:01,346 --> 00:42:03,637
AUDIENCE: Well, I mean, but you could have intermediate
听众：好吧，我是说，但是你可以有中级

1025
00:42:03,637 --> 00:42:05,650
where you step in the first one, then back.
首先进入第一个位置，然后返回。 

1026
00:42:05,849 --> 00:42:07,889
PROFESSOR: But I don't care because I've
教授：但是我不在乎，因为我已经

1027
00:42:07,889 --> 00:42:09,119
added these blank notes.
添加了这些空白便笺。 

1028
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:11,199
And they take care of my intermediates for me.
他们为我照顾了我的中间体。 

1029
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:12,699
AUDIENCE: But so, we're saying where
听众：但是，我们说的是

1030
00:42:12,699 --> 00:42:17,803
the feet land aren't part of the note.
脚的着地不属于音符的一部分。 

1031
00:42:17,804 --> 00:42:18,269
PROFESSOR: Nope.
教授：不。 

1032
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:19,639
They're just states.
他们只是国家。 

1033
00:42:19,639 --> 00:42:22,289
So they're a decision I'm making.
因此，这是我的决定。 

1034
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:24,815
AUDIENCE: So, do we have the multiple-- no,
听众：那么，我们是否有倍数-不， 

1035
00:42:24,815 --> 00:42:28,500
we don't because they're not part of the--
我们不是因为它们不属于- 

1036
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:34,760



1037
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,420
PROFESSOR: For each note position here,
教授：对于这里的每个音符位置， 

1038
00:42:37,619 --> 00:42:40,960
for every position in the screen thing,
屏幕上每个位置的东西

1039
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:45,539
I have multiple feet positions that I could be in.
我可能处于多个脚位置。 

1040
00:42:45,539 --> 00:42:46,362
AUDIENCE: Right.
听众：对。 

1041
00:42:46,362 --> 00:42:46,862
Right.
对。 

1042
00:42:46,862 --> 00:42:50,894
But then, are there multiple moves to get to those?
但是，要实现这些目标，是否有多种举措？ 

1043
00:42:50,894 --> 00:42:51,519
PROFESSOR: Yep.
教授：是的。 

1044
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:52,061
AUDIENCE: OK.
听众：好的。 

1045
00:42:52,061 --> 00:42:54,440
So there's multiple moves connecting each.
因此，有很多动作相互关联。 

1046
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:55,949
PROFESSOR: Yeah.
教授：是的。 

1047
00:42:55,949 --> 00:43:04,230
So for example, if I want to get to l r, up down here,
例如，如果我想去lr，在这里

1048
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:09,360
I can go from l r, up down in the blank.
我可以从lr到空白处。 

1049
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:12,760
Or, I could have l r be like this.
或者，我可能会像这样。 

1050
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:15,840
And then transition.
然后过渡。 

1051
00:43:16,039 --> 00:43:20,449
So I can have a lot of possible foot positions
所以我可以有很多可能的脚位

1052
00:43:20,449 --> 00:43:24,969
that I'm transitioning from in order to get here.
我要从这里过渡到这里。 

1053
00:43:24,969 --> 00:43:27,639
AUDIENCE: But those aren't actually
听众：但是这些实际上并不是

1054
00:43:27,639 --> 00:43:29,836
separate notes on the graph.
图上的单独注释。 

1055
00:43:29,836 --> 00:43:30,670
PROFESSOR: They are.
教授：是的。 

1056
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:33,619
They have to be.
他们必须是。 

1057
00:43:33,619 --> 00:43:36,259
So these all have to be separate notes.
因此，这些都必须单独注释。 

1058
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:38,400
Because the edges are going to have separate weights.
因为边缘将具有不同的权重。 

1059
00:43:38,599 --> 00:43:39,099
Right?
对？ 

1060
00:43:39,099 --> 00:43:40,679
This edge is going to have one weight.
该边缘将具有一个重量。 

1061
00:43:40,679 --> 00:43:42,159
This edge is going to have another weight.
这条边缘将有另一个分量。 

1062
00:43:42,159 --> 00:43:42,819
AUDIENCE: OK.
听众：好的。 

1063
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:43,536
That's what I thought.
那正是我所想。 

1064
00:43:43,735 --> 00:43:45,679
But then you said there was only one blank.
但是随后您说只有一个空白。 

1065
00:43:45,679 --> 00:43:51,998



1066
00:43:51,998 --> 00:43:54,911
Don't there have to be multiple blank notes for every foot
每只脚不必有多个空白便笺

1067
00:43:54,911 --> 00:43:55,609
thing.
事情。 

1068
00:43:55,610 --> 00:43:57,485
If you're approaching a note from different--
如果您要使用的音符不同， 

1069
00:43:57,485 --> 00:44:00,110



1070
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:04,840
PROFESSOR: So, I'm not sure what you're asking.
教授：所以，我不确定您要问什么。 

1071
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:06,596
So, if you want to care about centering,
因此，如果您想关心居中， 

1072
00:44:06,795 --> 00:44:08,419
if you want to have intermediate moves,
如果您想进行一些中间动作， 

1073
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:12,059
you need one blank note between every real note.
您需要在每个真实音符之间添加一个空白音符。 

1074
00:44:12,059 --> 00:44:16,121
So that you're allowed to make one intermediate move between.
这样您就可以在两者之间进行一个中间的移动。 

1075
00:44:16,121 --> 00:44:16,788
AUDIENCE: Right.
听众：对。 

1076
00:44:16,788 --> 00:44:21,184
I get that that's talking about the on the screen.
我知道那是关于屏幕上的内容。 

1077
00:44:21,184 --> 00:44:21,650
PROFESSOR: Yeah.
教授：是的。 

1078
00:44:21,849 --> 00:44:22,519
That's the screen.
那是屏幕。 

1079
00:44:22,519 --> 00:44:23,179
AUDIENCE: That's the screen.
听众：那是屏幕。 

1080
00:44:23,179 --> 00:44:23,804
PROFESSOR: Yep.
教授：是的。 

1081
00:44:23,804 --> 00:44:24,429
AUDIENCE: OK.
听众：好的。 

1082
00:44:24,429 --> 00:44:26,349
So, that's not the graph, though.
所以，那不是图形。 

1083
00:44:26,349 --> 00:44:28,759
Here, we're talking about the screen on the graph.
在这里，我们正在谈论图形上的屏幕。 

1084
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,780
PROFESSOR: Here, we're talking about the graph.
教授：在这里，我们谈论的是图表。 

1085
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:34,340
So two tells me that the screen is at note two.
所以两个告诉我屏幕在注释二。 

1086
00:44:34,539 --> 00:44:36,369
Whatever that happens to be.
无论发生什么。 

1087
00:44:36,369 --> 00:44:37,759
And my feet are in this position.
我的脚处于这个位置。 

1088
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,000



1089
00:44:40,199 --> 00:44:40,699
OK.
好。 

1090
00:44:40,699 --> 00:44:42,449
So that's very important.
所以这很重要。 

1091
00:44:42,449 --> 00:44:44,559
Thanks for asking because that's very important.
感谢您提出要求，因为这非常重要。 

1092
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:47,349
So, a state has the note that I'm landing at.
因此，一个州有我要降落的音符。 

1093
00:44:47,349 --> 00:44:48,650
So, where the screen is.
因此，屏幕在哪里。 

1094
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:50,184
And where my feet are.
而且我的脚在哪里。 

1095
00:44:50,184 --> 00:44:51,496
AUDIENCE: OK.
听众：好的。 

1096
00:44:51,496 --> 00:44:52,079
PROFESSOR: OK.
教授：好的。 

1097
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:54,269
AUDIENCE: The state corresponds to the nodes that you're on.
听众：状态对应于您所在的节点。 

1098
00:44:54,269 --> 00:44:55,019
PROFESSOR: A note.
教授：注意。 

1099
00:44:55,019 --> 00:44:56,940
A note is a state.
音符是一种状态。 

1100
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:58,230
So, a note is a state.
因此，注释是一种状态。 

1101
00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:01,070
And a move goes between two states.
并且在两个状态之间移动。 

1102
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:03,069
This is how we represent all the graph problems.
这就是我们表示所有图形问题的方式。 

1103
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:05,880



1104
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:08,050
OK.
好。 

1105
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:10,634
AUDIENCE: So, you need multiple blank.
听众：因此，您需要多个空白。 

1106
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:11,500
PROFESSOR: Yeah.
教授：是的。 

1107
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,389
So here, I'm just drawing one example.
所以在这里，我仅举一个例子。 

1108
00:45:13,389 --> 00:45:14,009
Yeah.
是的

1109
00:45:14,010 --> 00:45:14,039
Yeah.
是的

1110
00:45:14,239 --> 00:45:16,000
So for example, here I would need-- sorry.
例如，在这里我需要-抱歉。 

1111
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:16,588
Oh, OK.
哦好的。 

1112
00:45:16,588 --> 00:45:17,630
I get your confusion now.
我现在让你感到困惑。 

1113
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:18,128
So, yeah.
是的。 

1114
00:45:18,128 --> 00:45:20,929
This would be one move.
这将是一招。 

1115
00:45:20,929 --> 00:45:24,210
This would be another move.
这将是另一步。 

1116
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:26,795
AUDIENCE: That's all for a single thing on the screen.
听众：屏幕上的所有东西都是这样。 

1117
00:45:26,795 --> 00:45:27,419
PROFESSOR: Yep.
教授：是的。 

1118
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:28,286
AUDIENCE: OK.
听众：好的。 

1119
00:45:28,286 --> 00:45:28,784
OK.
好。 

1120
00:45:28,784 --> 00:45:29,694
That makes sense.
那讲得通。 

1121
00:45:29,695 --> 00:45:31,827
AUDIENCE: So the next note would have a really large end
听众：所以下一个音符的结局很大

1122
00:45:32,027 --> 00:45:32,839
degree, right?
学位，对不对？ 

1123
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:33,539
I guess they always have--
我想他们总是- 

1124
00:45:33,539 --> 00:45:34,099
AUDIENCE: Well, no.
听众：好吧，不。 

1125
00:45:34,099 --> 00:45:34,799
It'd have lots of--
它会有很多

1126
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,385
PROFESSOR: So, this note has a huge out degree.
教授：因此，此笔记的程度很高。 

1127
00:45:36,385 --> 00:45:37,010
AUDIENCE: Yeah.
听众：是的。 

1128
00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:40,237
But I'm saying the ones that all those intermediates connect to.
但我是说所有这些中间物都连接到的那些。 

1129
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:40,702
PROFESSOR: Yeah.
教授：是的。 

1130
00:45:40,902 --> 00:45:42,029
AUDIENCE: So, then, they would connect
听众：那么，他们会联系

1131
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:43,601
with some note that have, like, really large degree.
带有很大程度的音符

1132
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:44,284
PROFESSOR: Yep.
教授：是的。 

1133
00:45:44,284 --> 00:45:46,250
AUDIENCE: But there's two of them after that, right?
听众：但是那之后有两个，对吧？ 

1134
00:45:46,449 --> 00:45:48,294
Because there would be two different--
因为会有两个不同的地方- 

1135
00:45:48,295 --> 00:45:49,420
PROFESSOR: So, what's next?
教授：那接下来呢？ 

1136
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:52,829
Next, is position, hmm.
接下来是位置，嗯。 

1137
00:45:52,829 --> 00:45:54,210
How did U number them?
你是怎么给他们编号的？ 

1138
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:57,452
I guess, crap.
我猜，胡扯。 

1139
00:45:57,452 --> 00:46:02,911



1140
00:46:03,110 --> 00:46:03,609
No.
没有。 

1141
00:46:03,610 --> 00:46:05,079
It's not going to match that, so.
所以不会匹配的。 

1142
00:46:05,079 --> 00:46:08,449
Whatever we do, it's not going to match that.
无论我们做什么，都无法做到这一点。 

1143
00:46:08,449 --> 00:46:13,369
Say the next note, 4, is just an up.
再说下一个音符4，就好了。 

1144
00:46:13,369 --> 00:46:18,929



1145
00:46:18,929 --> 00:46:19,889
4 is up down.
 4是向下。 

1146
00:46:19,889 --> 00:46:21,879
And then I have two notes for it, right?
然后我有两个注释，对不对？ 

1147
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:22,800
Wild One note, l r.
狂野一音，l r。 

1148
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,130



1149
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:27,829
So this is note 4.
这就是注释4。 

1150
00:46:27,829 --> 00:46:29,059
That happens to be up down.
那恰好是下跌。 

1151
00:46:29,059 --> 00:46:32,269
And then I have this.
然后我有这个。 

1152
00:46:32,269 --> 00:46:40,766
And every one of these connects to every one of these.
这些中的每一个都连接到其中的每一个。 

1153
00:46:40,766 --> 00:46:42,349
AUDIENCE: If the next move is up down,
听众：如果下一步走高， 

1154
00:46:42,349 --> 00:46:43,560
how can notes have down up?
纸币如何下降？ 

1155
00:46:43,561 --> 00:46:45,059
Oh, because you can switch the feet.
哦，因为您可以换脚。 

1156
00:46:45,059 --> 00:46:45,556
PROFESSOR: Yep.
教授：是的。 

1157
00:46:45,556 --> 00:46:46,097
AUDIENCE: Oh.
听众：哦。 

1158
00:46:46,097 --> 00:46:48,324



1159
00:46:48,523 --> 00:46:49,190
PROFESSOR: Yeah.
教授：是的。 

1160
00:46:49,190 --> 00:46:51,773
So, I aimed to ask you guys, how am I going to draw the edges?
所以，我打算问你们，我要如何画边缘？ 

1161
00:46:51,773 --> 00:46:54,289
But you guys made me do it with questions.
但是你们让我提出了问题。 

1162
00:46:54,489 --> 00:46:57,039
So, suppose I met note n, l, r.
因此，假设我遇到了注n，l，r。 

1163
00:46:57,039 --> 00:46:59,759
What edges do I draw going out of it?
我要画出什么边缘？ 

1164
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,914
So, note n, left foot at some position.
因此，请注意n，左脚在某个位置。 

1165
00:47:01,914 --> 00:47:02,880
Right foot at some position.
右脚在某个位置。 

1166
00:47:03,079 --> 00:47:04,420
What are my outgoing edges?
我的外向优势是什么？ 

1167
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:07,476



1168
00:47:07,476 --> 00:47:09,099
AUDIENCE: This is a note on the screen.
听众：这是屏幕上的注释。 

1169
00:47:09,099 --> 00:47:09,619
Or--
要么 - 

1170
00:47:09,619 --> 00:47:09,859
PROFESSOR: In the graph.
教授：在图中。 

1171
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:11,693
AUDIENCE: --the new one or intermediate one?
听众：-新的还是中间的？ 

1172
00:47:11,693 --> 00:47:12,650
PROFESSOR: Doesn't matter.
教授：没关系。 

1173
00:47:12,849 --> 00:47:15,105
So, intermediate notes have a note blank.
因此，中级注释的注释为空白。 

1174
00:47:15,106 --> 00:47:16,480
AUDIENCE: That's just everything.
听众：仅此而已。 

1175
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:17,688
PROFESSOR: It doesn't matter.
教授：没关系。 

1176
00:47:17,688 --> 00:47:20,519
Yeah, we're looking at all of them at the same time.
是的，我们要同时查看所有这些。 

1177
00:47:20,719 --> 00:47:23,169
AUDIENCE: Wait, so you're asking what are--
听众：等等，所以您要问- 

1178
00:47:23,170 --> 00:47:26,320
PROFESSOR: So, given this note, who am I connecting it to?
教授：那么，给了这篇笔记，我应该和谁联系？ 

1179
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:28,510
Let's draw the outgoing edges.
让我们画出边缘。 

1180
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:30,960
So, if you're solving this as a graph problem,
因此，如果您将其作为图形问题解决， 

1181
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:31,860
you build the notes.
您建立笔记。 

1182
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:32,789
You draw the edges.
您绘制边缘。 

1183
00:47:32,989 --> 00:47:34,471
You're on some algorithm.
您正在使用某种算法。 

1184
00:47:34,471 --> 00:47:35,469
So let's draw the edges.
因此，让我们绘制边缘。 

1185
00:47:35,469 --> 00:47:38,022



1186
00:47:38,023 --> 00:47:40,481
AUDIENCE: I think it depends if you're an intermediate note
听众：我认为这取决于您是否是中级音符

1187
00:47:40,481 --> 00:47:41,780
or not.
或不。 

1188
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:42,400
PROFESSOR: Nope.
教授：不。 

1189
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:45,190
So the note tells you what your constraints are.
因此，该注释告诉您您的约束是什么。 

1190
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:48,829
And that covers intermediate notes.
这涵盖了中级音符。 

1191
00:47:48,829 --> 00:47:52,098
If you're note is a blank, then, well, there's no constraints.
如果您注意的是空白，那么没有任何限制。 

1192
00:47:52,099 --> 00:47:54,190
If the note is not a blank, then there are constraints.
如果注释不是空白，则存在约束。 

1193
00:47:54,389 --> 00:47:54,638
AUDIENCE: Oh, note.
听众：哦，注意。 

1194
00:47:54,639 --> 00:47:56,829
I thought that was referring to the note, not the--
我以为那是指笔记，而不是- 

1195
00:47:56,829 --> 00:47:57,413
PROFESSOR: No.
教授：不。 

1196
00:47:57,413 --> 00:47:58,860
So this is a note.
因此，这是一个注释。 

1197
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:00,400
Maybe n is not good.
也许n不好。 

1198
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:03,702
Let's use i, instead, then.
那么，让我们使用i。 

1199
00:48:03,702 --> 00:48:04,690
If n is hard.
如果n很难。 

1200
00:48:04,889 --> 00:48:08,646
So, i is the position here, in this guy.
所以，我是这个人的职位。 

1201
00:48:08,646 --> 00:48:09,145
Right?
对？ 

1202
00:48:09,146 --> 00:48:12,340



1203
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:13,815
Say for example, i equals 1 here.
举例来说，我在这里等于1。 

1204
00:48:14,014 --> 00:48:15,089
I equals 2 here.
我在这里等于2。 

1205
00:48:15,090 --> 00:48:15,760
I equals 3 here.
我在这里等于3。 

1206
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,070
So and so forth.
等等。 

1207
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:19,672
And that doesn't match this, so.
那与这个不匹配，所以。 

1208
00:48:19,672 --> 00:48:21,171
AUDIENCE: We're talking about note--
听众：我们正在谈论笔记- 

1209
00:48:21,172 --> 00:48:21,797
PROFESSOR: Yep.
教授：是的。 

1210
00:48:21,797 --> 00:48:23,570
AUDIENCE: --not--
听众：-不- 

1211
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:25,260
PROFESSOR: If one note is represented
教授：如果有一个音符

1212
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:26,510
by these three numbers, right?
用这三个数字吧？ 

1213
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:27,625
Each note has this tuple in it.
每个音符都有这个元组。 

1214
00:48:27,824 --> 00:48:29,494
AUDIENCE: Then i is the note.
听众：那么我就是音符。 

1215
00:48:29,494 --> 00:48:30,119
PROFESSOR: Yep.
教授：是的。 

1216
00:48:30,119 --> 00:48:32,027
AUDIENCE: So i connects to i plus 1.
听众：所以我连接到我加1。 

1217
00:48:32,027 --> 00:48:34,096
And then all possibilities known.
然后所有可能性都知道了。 

1218
00:48:34,097 --> 00:48:34,480
PROFESSOR: OK.
教授：好的。 

1219
00:48:34,679 --> 00:48:36,609
So this connects to i plus 1.
所以这连接到我加1。 

1220
00:48:36,610 --> 00:48:40,880
And then all possible destinations, right?
然后是所有可能的目的地，对不对？ 

1221
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:44,380
So I'm going to say left.
所以我要说左。 

1222
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:45,360
This is after the jump.
这是跳跃之后。 

1223
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:48,630
So, left after the jump, and right after the jump.
因此，跳后左移，跳后右移。 

1224
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:54,340
And this is for all possible left after a jump,
这是跳跃后剩下的所有可能的东西， 

1225
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:55,710
right after the jump.
跳后

1226
00:48:55,710 --> 00:49:02,780
And lost a weight on this edge.
并失去了这一优势。 

1227
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:05,940
AUDIENCE: The way that it's from--
观众：来源- 

1228
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:06,728
AUDIENCE: l r to
听众：lr to 

1229
00:49:06,728 --> 00:49:08,996
AUDIENCE: --l r to l r.
听众：--lr至l r。 

1230
00:49:08,996 --> 00:49:10,079
AUDIENCE: l j-- l sub j r.
听众：l j-- l sub j r。 

1231
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:11,769
AUDIENCE: l r.
听众：l r。 

1232
00:49:11,769 --> 00:49:16,849
PROFESSOR: So you want to say from l r to l j, r j.
教授：所以您想说从lr到lj，r j。 

1233
00:49:16,849 --> 00:49:18,855
But what?
但是呢

1234
00:49:18,855 --> 00:49:19,980
AUDIENCE: Difficulty level?
听众：难度级别？ 

1235
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:20,646
PROFESSOR: Yeah.
教授：是的。 

1236
00:49:20,646 --> 00:49:21,922
Where is that?
哪里是？ 

1237
00:49:21,922 --> 00:49:23,380
AUDIENCE: Your difficulty function.
听众：您的难度函数。 

1238
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:24,423
PROFESSOR: Which is?
教授：那是什么？ 

1239
00:49:24,423 --> 00:49:25,090
AUDIENCE: Delta.
听众：三角洲。 

1240
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:27,150
PROFESSOR: Delta.
教授：达美航空。 

1241
00:49:27,349 --> 00:49:27,849
So, yeah.
是的。 

1242
00:49:27,849 --> 00:49:29,710
The weight is delta.
重量为增量。 

1243
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:31,019
I drew d.
我画了d。 

1244
00:49:31,219 --> 00:49:36,879
Delta of these two foot positions.
这两个脚位置的Delta。 

1245
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:37,460
Almost.
几乎。 

1246
00:49:37,659 --> 00:49:42,259
If I want to minimize the difficulty, then this is right.
如果我想最小化难度，那是对的。 

1247
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:43,840
If I want to maximize a score, then I
如果我想最大化分数，那么我

1248
00:49:44,039 --> 00:49:47,403
would have to add a minus sign.
将必须添加一个减号。 

1249
00:49:47,403 --> 00:49:49,070
But if you're minimizing the difficulty,
但是，如果您将难度降到最低， 

1250
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:51,519
this is exactly the way because it maps the shortest path.
这正是方法，因为它映射了最短的路径。 

1251
00:49:51,519 --> 00:49:55,302
Usually, in dynamic programming, things are maximized.
通常，在动态编程中，事物被最大化。 

1252
00:49:55,302 --> 00:49:57,385
AUDIENCE: Wait, why would you add a minus if it's--
听众：等等，为什么要加上减号，如果- 

1253
00:49:57,585 --> 00:49:59,459
PROFESSOR: So, if we're maximizing something,
教授：所以，如果我们要最大限度地发挥作用， 

1254
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:02,164
we have to flip-- we have to add a minus to the edge costs
我们必须翻转-我们必须在边缘成本上加上减号

1255
00:50:02,164 --> 00:50:02,664
because--
因为 - 

1256
00:50:02,664 --> 00:50:03,519
AUDIENCE: Right.
听众：对。 

1257
00:50:03,519 --> 00:50:03,699
PROFESSOR: Yeah.
教授：是的。 

1258
00:50:03,699 --> 00:50:05,589
But this time we're minimizing something.
但是这次我们要最小化一些东西。 

1259
00:50:05,590 --> 00:50:05,802
AUDIENCE: Oh.
听众：哦。 

1260
00:50:05,802 --> 00:50:06,579
Right, right, right.
对，对，对。 

1261
00:50:06,579 --> 00:50:08,259
PROFESSOR: I promised you that we'll maximize something
教授：我向你保证，我们会尽最大努力

1262
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:08,730
all the time.
每时每刻。 

1263
00:50:08,730 --> 00:50:09,630
Well, I guess I lied.
好吧，我想我撒了谎。 

1264
00:50:09,630 --> 00:50:09,884
AUDIENCE: OK.
听众：好的。 

1265
00:50:10,083 --> 00:50:10,538
Right, right, right.
对，对，对。 

1266
00:50:10,538 --> 00:50:12,161
AUDIENCE: You don't want to maximize d.
听众：您不想最大化d。 

1267
00:50:12,161 --> 00:50:13,719
Then you're dead.
那你就死定了

1268
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:14,438
PROFESSOR: No.
教授：不。 

1269
00:50:14,438 --> 00:50:15,730
You want to maximize show offs.
您想最大化炫耀。 

1270
00:50:15,730 --> 00:50:17,090
So if we have the entertainment thing,
所以如果我们有娱乐的东西， 

1271
00:50:17,090 --> 00:50:18,210
then that would be maximized.
那么那将被最大化。 

1272
00:50:18,210 --> 00:50:19,289
And then you'd have minus.
然后你会减去。 

1273
00:50:19,289 --> 00:50:20,135
AUDIENCE: Then you'd have everything you need.
听众：然后，您将拥有所需的一切。 

1274
00:50:20,135 --> 00:50:20,760
PROFESSOR: Yep.
教授：是的。 

1275
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:21,610
AUDIENCE: OK.
听众：好的。 

1276
00:50:21,610 --> 00:50:23,109
PROFESSOR: OK, so we're almost good.
教授：好的，我们差不多。 

1277
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:26,630
Source notes and destination notes.
源注释和目标注释。 

1278
00:50:26,630 --> 00:50:27,846
AUDIENCE: Well, I guess source, we
观众：好吧，我想消息来源，我们

1279
00:50:28,045 --> 00:50:30,141
know that means start in the middle.
知道那意味着从中间开始。 

1280
00:50:30,141 --> 00:50:30,641
Right?
对？ 

1281
00:50:30,641 --> 00:50:33,719
Like, you would start off with--
就像，你会开始- 

1282
00:50:33,719 --> 00:50:35,328
PROFESSOR: What's the source?
教授：来源是什么？ 

1283
00:50:35,329 --> 00:50:36,920
You want to start at the first note, right?
您想从第一个音符开始，对吗？ 

1284
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:38,509
AUDIENCE: Yeah.
听众：是的。 

1285
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:40,581
PROFESSOR: But in which position?
教授：但是在哪个位置？ 

1286
00:50:40,581 --> 00:50:42,065
AUDIENCE: Well, in the center, right?
听众：好吧，在中心，对吧？ 

1287
00:50:42,264 --> 00:50:43,987
I mean, the [INAUDIBLE] start.
我的意思是，[听不清]开始。 

1288
00:50:43,987 --> 00:50:45,195
Or, I guess you could start--
或者，我想您可以开始- 

1289
00:50:45,195 --> 00:50:47,699
AUDIENCE: Wherever you want.
听众：无论您在哪里。 

1290
00:50:47,699 --> 00:50:49,039
AUDIENCE: Could you add a source note
听众：您能添加原始记录吗

1291
00:50:49,239 --> 00:50:51,059
going to a bunch of intermediate notes?
去一堆中级音符？ 

1292
00:50:51,059 --> 00:50:52,179
PROFESSOR: Yeah.
教授：是的。 

1293
00:50:52,179 --> 00:50:52,679
Yeah.
是的

1294
00:50:52,679 --> 00:50:56,509
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to say there is a note 0.
因此，我要说的是音符0。 

1295
00:50:56,510 --> 00:50:59,275
That let's me choose how I'm going to start.
那让我选择开始的方式。 

1296
00:50:59,474 --> 00:51:01,099
AUDIENCE: Oh, it could be any position.
听众：哦，可能是任何位置。 

1297
00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:02,889
It's like an intermediate note itself.
它本身就像一个中级音符。 

1298
00:51:02,889 --> 00:51:03,514
PROFESSOR: Yep.
教授：是的。 

1299
00:51:03,514 --> 00:51:06,179



1300
00:51:06,179 --> 00:51:09,690
So I'm going to have a note 0, with all possible foot
所以我要记下音符0，所有可能的支脚

1301
00:51:09,690 --> 00:51:11,760
positions.
职位。 

1302
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:15,340
And then this is going to be connected to a source,
然后将其连接到源， 

1303
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:18,086
by edges of weight 0.
按权重0的边。 

1304
00:51:18,086 --> 00:51:20,670
So the intuition is that I get to choose my starting position,
因此，直觉是我可以选择自己的开始位置， 

1305
00:51:20,670 --> 00:51:21,710
right?
对？ 

1306
00:51:21,710 --> 00:51:23,360
Starting position.
起始位置。 

1307
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:24,440
I see the first note.
我看到第一个音符。 

1308
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:26,019
I make a move.
我走了

1309
00:51:26,019 --> 00:51:28,280
So I want to be able to choose the starting position.
因此，我希望能够选择起始位置。 

1310
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:29,820
That's why I have all those notes.
这就是为什么我有所有这些笔记。 

1311
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:32,170
And then make a move to touch the first note.
然后移动以触摸第一个音符。 

1312
00:51:32,369 --> 00:51:35,842



1313
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:38,322
AUDIENCE: The starting position is also a note.
听众：起始位置也是一个注释。 

1314
00:51:38,322 --> 00:51:39,820
PROFESSOR: Yep.
教授：是的。 

1315
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:43,289
Because, if the first note is here,
因为，如果第一个音符在这里， 

1316
00:51:43,489 --> 00:51:45,500
I don't necessarily want to start like this
我不一定要这样开始

1317
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:47,820
because maybe this is harder than this.
因为也许这比这难。 

1318
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:52,295



1319
00:51:52,295 --> 00:51:52,795
All right.
好吧。 

1320
00:51:52,795 --> 00:51:53,753
What's the destination?
目的地是哪里？ 

1321
00:51:53,753 --> 00:51:56,898



1322
00:51:56,898 --> 00:51:58,400
AUDIENCE: The last note.
听众：最后一点。 

1323
00:51:58,400 --> 00:51:59,730
PROFESSOR: OK.
教授：好的。 

1324
00:51:59,929 --> 00:52:04,789
So, all the notes that are at note n, and have any position,
因此，所有在音符n上并处于任意位置的音符

1325
00:52:04,789 --> 00:52:06,719
would be connected to a destination note,
将连接到目的地记录， 

1326
00:52:06,719 --> 00:52:09,659
using an edge of weight 0.
使用权重为0的边。 

1327
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:11,509
Or I can consider them as destinations.
或者我可以将它们视为目的地。 

1328
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:16,340
And then choose the destination that has the shortest path.
然后选择路径最短的目的地。 

1329
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:18,579
AUDIENCE: Oh, I see.
听众：哦，我知道了。 

1330
00:52:18,579 --> 00:52:23,319
The final destination is going to be, like, two notes.
最终目的地将是两个音符。 

1331
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:23,820
Right?
对？ 

1332
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:25,242
It's going to be that last position, and then--
这将是最后一个位置，然后- 

1333
00:52:25,242 --> 00:52:26,865
PROFESSOR: Or it might be more than two
教授：或者可能不止两个

1334
00:52:26,865 --> 00:52:29,900
if the note is just a simple note.
如果笔记只是一个简单的笔记。 

1335
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:32,030
Because that wouldn't constrain my feet too much.
因为那不会太大约束我的脚。 

1336
00:52:32,030 --> 00:52:32,530
OK.
好。 

1337
00:52:32,530 --> 00:52:34,769
And last, last question.
最后，最后一个问题。 

1338
00:52:34,769 --> 00:52:36,382
Dijkstra or Bellman-Ford?
 Dijkstra还是Bellman-Ford？ 

1339
00:52:36,382 --> 00:52:37,840
AUDIENCE: Bellman-Ford, because you
观众：贝尔曼·福特，因为你

1340
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:41,235
have negative edges, negative weight,
负边，负重

1341
00:52:41,235 --> 00:52:45,130
as if you were going to maximize to death.
仿佛你要最大化死亡。 

1342
00:52:45,130 --> 00:52:48,059
PROFESSOR: So, this is always going to be from 0 to 1.
教授：因此，它总是从0到1。 

1343
00:52:48,059 --> 00:52:50,489
So I could possibly use Dijkstra.
所以我可能会使用Dijkstra。 

1344
00:52:50,489 --> 00:52:51,549
The answer is neither.
答案都不是。 

1345
00:52:51,550 --> 00:52:54,175
The answer is, we're building a DAG, so.
答案是，我们正在构建DAG。 

1346
00:52:54,175 --> 00:52:54,766
AUDIENCE: Dijkstra.
听众：Dijkstra。 

1347
00:52:54,965 --> 00:52:56,730
AUDIENCE: We don't use that.
听众：我们不使用它。 

1348
00:52:56,730 --> 00:52:57,980
PROFESSOR: DAG, shortest path.
教授：DAG，最短路径。 

1349
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:00,349
Every time we have dynamic programming, DAG,
每次我们进行动态编程，DAG， 

1350
00:53:00,349 --> 00:53:02,819
shortest path.
最短路径。 

1351
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:03,320
OK?
好？ 

1352
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:04,039
AUDIENCE: Question.
听众：问题。 

1353
00:53:04,239 --> 00:53:05,159
PROFESSOR: Yeah.
教授：是的。 

1354
00:53:05,159 --> 00:53:06,359
Come on, last question.
来，最后一个问题。 

1355
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:08,000
You can't get away that easily.
您无法轻易摆脱。 

1356
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:08,550
OK, so.
好吧

1357
00:53:08,550 --> 00:53:10,400
Who wants to play?
谁想玩？ 

1358
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:15,400
